Troubleshooting Methodology
An effective troubleshooting methodology follows a set of steps to diagnose and fix a computer.

1. Identify the problem
• Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable,
perform backups before making changes
• Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
2. Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
• If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
3. Test the theory to determine the cause
• Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
• If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
• Refer to the vendor’s instruction for guidance
5. Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
6. Document the findings, actions, and outcome
