### Facing the Realities of Electrical Dangers

There’s no escaping the simple fact that an electric shock, if strong enough, can kill you. So whenever you work with electricity, you must be sure to take every
precaution you can to avoid being the recipient of a shock strong enough to do
damage.


#### Household electrical current can kill you!

Too many people are under the false impression that the 120 volts of alternating
current running through household electrical wires isn’t enough to kill. So let’s
start by getting one fact straight:
The electricity in your home wiring system is more than strong enough to kill you.


You’re exposed to household electrical current primarily in two places: in electri-
cal outlets and in the lamp sockets within light fixtures. As a result, you should be
extra careful whenever you plug or unplug something into or from an electrical
outlet, and you should be careful whenever you change a light bulb. Specifically,
you should follow these precautions:

» Never change a light bulb when the light is turned on. If the light is
controlled by a switch, turn the switch off. If the light isn’t controlled by a
switch, unplug the light from the wall outlet.
» If an extension cord becomes frayed or damaged in any way, discard it.
When the insulation begins to rub off of an extension cord, the shock hazard
is very real.
» Never perform electrical wiring work while the circuit is energized. If you
insist on changing your own light switches or electrical outlets, always turn off
the power to the circuit by turning off the circuit breaker that controls the
circuit before you begin. Many people die every year because they think that
they can be careful enough to safely work with live power.

» Never work on an AC-powered appliance when it has power applied.
Simply turning the appliance off isn’t enough to be safe. If the appliance has a
power cord, unplug it before you work on it. If it doesn’t have a power cord,
turn off the power to the appliance by throwing the circuit breaker on your
home’s electrical panel.
» Take extra precautions when you’re working with your own AC circuits.



IS IT TRUE THAT CURRENT,
NOT VOLTAGE, KILLS?
There is an old adage that “it’s the current that kills, not the voltage.” Although this state-
ment may be technically true, it’s also dangerously misleading. In fact, it stems from a
fundamental misunderstanding of what current and voltage are. It can cause you to
take dangerous risks if you don’t understand the relationship between current and
voltage.
The danger from electric shock occurs as current passes through vital parts of your
body — specifically, your heart. It takes only a few milliamperes of current to stop your
heart. At somewhere around 10 mA, muscles seize up, making it impossible to let go
if you’re holding a live wire. At around 15 mA, the muscles in your chest can seize up,
making it impossible to breath. And at around 60 mA, your heart can stop. It takes only
a few moments of exposure for these effects to occur.
So yes, it is current passing through your body that can kill you.
But current is inseparable from voltage. Current can’t happen without voltage, and all
other things being equal, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. As a result, it’s
very difficult to receive a lethal shock from three volts even if you’re dripping wet and
standing on bare concrete. But under those conditions, 30 volts may be enough to cre-
ate a painful and damaging shock.
Saying “it’s the current that kills, not the voltage” is kind of like saying “it’s lack of oxygen,
not water” that causes drowning. Although it may be technically true, isn’t it the water
that causes the lack of oxygen?



Even relatively small voltages can hurt you
Most of the projects in this book work with AA batteries, usually two or four of
them tied together to produce a total of three or six volts. That’s not enough volt-
age to do serious harm. Even if you do get a shock with three or six volts, you will
probably barely feel it.
However, it’s possible to injure yourself with voltages even as low as three or six
volts. If you accidentally create a short circuit between the two poles of a battery,
a lot of current will flow very fast. This will very likely cause the wire connecting
the two ends of the battery to get very hot, and the battery itself may also heat up.
The heat may be enough to inflict a nasty burn.
If the racing current goes unchecked, there’s also the possibility that the bat-
tery will explode. Trust me; you don’t want to be nearby if that happens. You
really don’t want to make a trip to the emergency room to have fragments of an
exploded battery removed from your eyes.
As a result of this danger, you should take the following precautions when work-
ing with the battery-powered circuits described in this book:
» Don’t connect power to the circuit until the circuit is completely finished
and you’ve reviewed your work to ensure that everything is con-
nected properly.
» Don’t leave your circuits unattended when they’re connected to power.
Always remove the batteries before you walk away from your workbench.
» Periodically touch the batteries with your finger to make sure they
aren’t hot. If they’re getting warm, remove the batteries and recheck your
circuit to make sure you haven’t made a wiring mistake.
» If you smell anything burning, remove the batteries and recheck your
circuit.

» Always wear protective eyewear to protect yourself against exploding
batteries. (Under the right circumstances, other components can explode
as well!)


STAYING SAFE BY STAYING DRY
We’ve all seen murders committed on TV crime dramas by throwing a plugged-in electri-
cal appliance such as a hair dryer into a bathtub while the victim was taking a bath. I’ve
always wondered how often that really happens, and how likely it’s fatal. For example,
how quickly would the circuit breaker kick in and cut power to the hair dryer? Would
the special GFCI-protection devices required in all modern bathrooms work as designed
and cut power to the hair dryer in time?
I’ve never wanted to conduct an experiment to actually find out — nor should you,
under any circumstances. Water and electricity are a very bad combination because
water is an excellent conductor of electricity, and it flows everywhere.
Strictly speaking, pure uncontaminated water is actually an insulator. But pure water
is very rare. Most water is filled with contaminates, and those contaminants turn the
water into an excellent conductor. Thus, it’s true that you should avoid water when
working with electrical current. Here are a few tips for staying safe by staying dry:
• Make sure the floor is dry. Don’t work on electronic or electrical devices in an area
where the floor is wet.
• Beware of high humidity, especially if it condenses into moisture on your
projects.
• Dry your hands before working with electrical current. Even a small amount of
sweat on your hands can lower your body’s natural resistance and accentuate the
danger of electrical shocks from lower voltages.




### Unexpected Voltage
One of the biggest shock risks in electronics comes from voltages that you
didn’t expect to be present. It’s easy enough to keep your eye on the voltages that
you know about, such as in your power supply or batteries, but some electronic
circuits are designed to amplify voltages. So even though your circuit runs on
6-volt batteries, there may be much larger voltages at specific points within your
circuit.


In addition, some electrical devices can actually store an electric charge long after
the power from your circuit has been disconnected. The most notorious device
with this characteristic is the capacitor, which alternately builds up and then
releases electrical charges. Thus, you should be wary of any circuit that contains
capacitors — especially if the capacitors are large. Common ceramic-disk capac-
itors, which are typically smaller than a tiddlywink, don’t store much charge.
However, if your circuit has capacitors the size of batteries, you should be very
careful when working around them. Such capacitors can hold large charges long
after the power has been cut off.

Here are some safety points concerning capacitors:
» One of the most common places to find large capacitors is in the
power-supply circuit. Any electronic device that plugs into a household
electrical outlet has a power-supply circuit that may contain a large capacitor.
Be very careful around these capacitors. In fact, if the power-supply circuit is
inside its own enclosed box, don’t open the box. Instead, replace the entire
power supply if you suspect it’s bad.
» Another common place to find high-voltage capacitors is in a flash
camera. Even though the battery may be just 1.5 V, the capacitor that drives
the flash unit may well be holding a charge of 300 V or more.
» Before working on a circuit that contains a capacitor, always discharge
the capacitor first. You can discharge small capacitors by shorting out their
leads with the blade of a screwdriver. Make sure you touch only the insulated
handle of the screwdriver while you short out the leads, and don’t touch any
other part of the circuit with your free hand.
» Larger capacitors should be discharged by connecting their leads to a
lamp or a large resistor. The easiest way to do this is to wire up a lamp
holder to a pair of alligator clips, screw a lamp into the lamp holder, then
carefully connect the clips to the capacitor leads. If the capacitor is holding a
charge, the lamp will glow for a moment as the capacitor discharges through
the lamp.
» If you don’t feel completely confident in what you’re doing where large
capacitors are concerned, walk away from the project.


### Other Ways to Stay Safe
» Soldering poses an obvious fire hazard. If your soldering iron is hot enough
to melt solder, it’s also hot enough to ignite combustible materials such as
paper, wire insulation, and so on. Therefore:
• Always be aware of when your soldering iron is on. Don’t plug it in until you
need it, and unplug it when you’re finished soldering.
• Never set a hot soldering iron down directly on your workbench. Instead, get a
soldering iron holder to safely hold the soldering iron while it’s hot.

Give your soldered joints a few minutes to cool down before you handle them.
• Watch out for the soldering iron’s electrical cord. Obviously, you want to avoid
burning the cord with the soldering iron. As ridiculous as it sounds, I did
this myself once when I carelessly set the soldering iron aside, directly on
top of its own power cord. Fortunately, I noticed my mistake before the
soldering iron melted much of the power cord’s insulation.
Make sure the soldering iron’s power cord is placed safely away from your
stuff so that you won’t bump it as you work, knocking it out of its stand and
perhaps causing a burn.

Be sure to wear eye protection when you solder. As solder melts, it occasion-
ally boils and splatters little globules of hot solder through the air. You
really don’t want molten metal anywhere near your eyes.
» Electronics — and especially soldering — can also create a chemical
hazard. When you solder, small amounts of lead are released into the air.
Therefore:
• Always work in a well-ventilated place.
• Wash your hands after you work with solder or any other electronic compo-
nents before you touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes. Small amounts of lead
and potentially other toxic substances are bound to get on your hands. It’s
best to wash them frequently to keep whatever gunk they pick up from
getting into your body.
• Keep your soldering tools away from children. Young children and pets love
to stick things in their mouths. If you leave solder or little electronic parts
like resistors or diodes sitting loose on top of your workbench, your kids or
pets may decide to make a meal of them, so keep such things safely stored
in boxes or cabinets and, if possible, keep your entire work area safely off-
limits and behind closed doors.
• Don’t get into the habit of sticking parts into your mouth to hold them while
you’re working. As crazy as it sounds, I’ve seen people hold a dozen resistors
in their mouth while soldering each one into a printed circuit board. That’s
definitely a bad idea.
» Working with sharp tools such as knives, wire cutters, and power drills
creates a risk of cutting injury. Therefore:
• Think before you cut. Make sure you know exactly where you want to make
the cut, and make sure you know exactly where all your fingers are before
you start the cut.
• Let the tool do the work. Don’t apply excessive force to coerce a tool into
making a bigger, deeper, or wider cut than it’s designed to do.
• Keep your tools sharp. Working with dull tools causes you to use extra force,
which often results in the tool slipping and finding itself lodged in your
finger.
• Remove jewelry such as rings, wristwatches, and long dangling necklaces before
you start — especially if you’re working with power tools.
• Wear safety goggles whenever you’re cutting, sawing, or drilling. Little pieces of
the work or blade can easily break off and hit you in the face. Add bits of
insulation, copper wire, and broken drill bits to the growing list of things
you don’t want in your eyes.



### Keeping Safety Equipment on Hand
In spite of every precaution you might take, accidents are bound to happen as you
work with electronics. Other than preventing an accident from happening in the
first place, the best strategy for dealing with an accident is to be prepared for it,
so I recommend you keep the following items nearby whenever you’re working
with electronics:
» Fire extinguisher: So you can quickly put out any fire that might start before
it gets out of hand.
» First-aid kit: For treating small cuts and abrasions as well as small burns. The kit
should include bandages, antibacterial creams or sprays, and burn ointments.
» Phone: So that you can call for assistance in case something goes really wrong.
» Friend: If your project works with household current (120 volts), a friend can
help in case you get shocked.


### Protecting Your Stuff from Static Discharges

Static electricity — more properly called electrostatic charge — results when electric
charges (that is, voltage) builds up in the absence of a circuit that allows current
to flow. Your own body is frequently the carrier of static charge, which can be cre-
ated by a variety of causes. The most common is friction that results from simple
things such as walking across a carpet. Your clothes can also pick up static charge,
and usually do when you toss them around in a clothes dryer.
Static charge accumulated in your body usually discharges itself over time. How-
ever, if you touch a conductor — such as a brass doorknob — while you’re charged
up, the charge will dissipate itself quickly in an annoying shock.
If the conductor happens to be a sensitive electronic component such as a tran-
sistor or an integrated circuit rather than a brass doorknob, the discharge can be
more than annoying; it can fry the innards of the component, rendering it use-
less for your projects. For this reason, it’s wise to protect your stuff from static
discharge when you work on your electronic projects. The easiest way to do that
is to make sure you’re properly discharged before you start your work. If you have
a metal workbench or a large metal tool such as a drill press or grinder near your
workbench, simply reach out and touch it after you’ve settled in to your seat and
before you begin your work.
70 BOOK 1 Getting Started with Electronics
A more reliable way to protect your gear from static discharge is to wear a spe-
cial antistatic wristband on one wrist, as shown in Figure 4-2. Wear the wristband
tightly so that it’s in good solid contact with your skin all the way around your
wrist. Then, plug the alligator clip into a metal surface such as your workbench
frame or that nearby drill press.
For best results, the alligator clip on your antistatic wristband should be con-
nected to a proper earth ground. To create a proper earth ground, clamp a long
length of wire to a metal water pipe. The wire should be long enough to reach
from the pipe to your workbench. Carefully route the wire from the pipe to your
workbench, strip off an inch or so of insulation, and staple or clamp the wire to
the workbench, leaving the stripped end free so you can attach the alligator clip
from your antistatic wristband to it. (Note that this technique works only if the
building uses metal pipes throughout. If the building uses plastic pipe, the water-
pipe won’t provide a proper ground.)
An often-recommended way to connect the wristband to an earth ground is to
connect it to the ground receptacle of a properly grounded electrical outlet. I’m
definitely not a fan of this method, as the key to its operation lies in the term
“properly grounded electrical outlet.” All it takes is one stupid wiring mistake, or
one wire shaken loose by a sonic boom or a mild earthquake, and suddenly that
ground wire might not be a ground wire anymore — it might be energized. Call me
paranoid if you wish, but there’s no way I can recommend strapping a conductor
around your wrist and then plugging it into an electrical outlet.
