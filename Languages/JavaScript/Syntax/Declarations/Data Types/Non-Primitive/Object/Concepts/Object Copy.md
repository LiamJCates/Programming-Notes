### Object vs Variable Copy

Besides the formal differences, there are also some technical differences which affect how we use each data type. When you define a primitive variable, it will contain a copy of the information provided to it:
```js
let data = 42;
// dataCopy will store a copy of what data contains, so a copy of 42
let dataCopy = data;

// which means that making changes to dataCopy won't affect data
dataCopy = 43;

console.log(data); // 42
console.log(dataCopy); // 43
```

On the other hand, when you define an object variable, it will contain a reference to the object provided to it:

```js
// obj contains a reference to the object we defined on the right side
const obj = { data: 42 };
// objCopy will contain a reference to the object referenced by obj
const objCopy = obj;

// making changes to objCopy will make changes to the object that it refers to
objCopy.data = 43;

console.log(obj); // { data: 43 }
console.log(objCopy); // { data: 43 }
```
