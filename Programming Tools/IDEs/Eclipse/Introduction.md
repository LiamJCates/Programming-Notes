# Introduction

The documents in this folder are designed to make you quickly productive in the Eclipse integrated development environment.
<br/>
These tutorials will use a Java development environment to provide examples of the use and configuration of Eclipse.
<br/>
Eclipse is a very capable and sometimes complex product. For flexibility, it's designed on a plug-in architecture. This makes it extremely useful for software development for a wide variety of languages and target platforms.
<br/>
So even though the documents in this folder describe a Java use, your investment here can pay off many times over.
<br/><br/>

## What Are the Most Popular IDEs?

The Java IDE offer is not that big in the Java space, but we still have three tools to choose from

#### NetBeans
used to be developed by Sun Microsystems
Oracle bought the Sun Company and then given to the Apache Foundation by Oracle.
NetBeans is freely available. It is an open source software, very high quality, great tool to build Java applications.
<br/>
#### IntelliJ
developed by a company called JetBrains. There is a free open source Apache 2. 0 licensed Community Edition of this tool and a payed "Ultimate Version" with more features, more elements in it
<br/>
#### Eclipse
flagship software of the Eclipse Foundation.
Eclipse used to be developed by the IBM Company and then has been given to the Eclipse Foundation
<br/><br/>

## Market Share
Currently, the most widely used is with no doubt Eclipse, used by more than half of the Java developers, which is currently more than 6 million people in the world.
NetBeans is used by probably something like 10 to 12% of the Java developers.
JetBrains has a share of about 30 to 35%.
<br/><br/>

## Why Use Eclipse?

Somewhat like Java itself, Eclipse holds promise for a learn once, use everywhere.
* It's open source
* It's cross platform.
* It's plug-in based, and there are a lot of plug-ins.
<br/>

An open source project means Eclipse constantly evolves with a major regular release scheduled every year. Cross platform compatibility means that Eclipse will always be available to use.
And most tools that benefit from IDE integration have a plug-in. <br/>
Once you've learned Eclipse, you'll be up to speed on several other IDEs automatically.
