You're nearing the end of a job interview, the interviewer asks:
"That's all of our questions do you have any questions for us?"


Do not say "I think you answered everything for me, I think I'm good"
no you have questions, you always have questions

<<<<<<< HEAD
"what's the next step in this process" is not a good question
=======
While you can say "what's the next step in this process" it's not a compelling question and doesn't indicate that you are interested in the role.
>>>>>>> 0da5476467020f5c362500407c580ee5523234f8




you want to ask questions you genuinely have
what are the concerns you have for this position
what do you really want to know about the company

you want to ask questions that are also showing that you are looking to
succeed in this position, be forward-thinking in your questions.
So when you're preparing for the interview jot down some questions you have
You will want to have a couple of questions ready



Types of questions you want to ask
company culture
What it takes to be successful
challenges in the department

<<<<<<< HEAD
culture questions
"what's a typical work week like here?""
If you ask about a typical day every company's response will be:
"well there's no such thing it's a typical day"

You'll learn about what it's like to work there so it shows that you have
interest in what they do but you're also getting information so you can see can I picture myself in this environment
=======
Always have at least three questions, because inevitably one or more will be answered for you during the interview






Culture Questions:

Don't ask "Can you tell me about a typical day in this position"
because when you ask this, every company will respond:
"well there's no such thing it's a typical day"

Instead ask "what's a typical work week like here"

it shows that you have interest in what the company does and how they achieve it
You'll learn about what it's like to work there so you can picture yourself in this environment
>>>>>>> 0da5476467020f5c362500407c580ee5523234f8


Success Questions:
These questions show you are thinking of what it takes to be successful in this position:

Ask "what should someone in this position accomplish in the first 90 days"

"what are the traits that make people successful in this position"
or
"how have past employees been successful in this position"


Ask about challenges:
it shows that you're not afraid of a challenge and are keen on problem solving

"what are some of the challenges you foresee someone in this role tackling in the next six months"

it shows once again that you are already trying to figure out how am I going to
do well here how can I do my best for you


culture:
try to connect with the interviewer while also getting some idea of the


"what made you choose to work here?""

"what is your favorite part about working for this company or this department?"

make sure you're not asking questions that you could Google the answer

<<<<<<< HEAD
Asking about culture
ask about the department not the company because most companies now you can learn about their company culture on their LinkedIn page or website
but you can't find out about that department so I tend to ask
=======
I love asking about culture
ask it about the department not the company because most companies now you can learn about their company culture on their LinkedIn page or on their website
>>>>>>> 0da5476467020f5c362500407c580ee5523234f8

what's the culture of this department



<<<<<<< HEAD
I try to have
one that's success driven
one that's culture related
one that's more connecting
=======

the question you have to ask, while scary, is
"Based on what we talked about today, is there anything that would make you hesitant about hiring me for this position?""


they're going to give you an answer
sometimes it's not the answer you want to hear
sometimes it's something directly related to the position
sometimes interviewers are blatantly honest and say well you just don't have these skills so we've had stronger candidates

the beauty of it is you know right away not to be waiting by the phone for their
call you can pick yourself right back up and apply for other positions because you know this one's probably just not it
skills or experience you can't help that you don't have

They might say you don't have a lot of experience in this area
this is now your chance to
make the argument for why you should get
the position anyways

this question allows you the opportunity to fight for the job

so they say you haven't had a lot of experience doing XYZ well that is why I'm so excited to work here I love a new challenge and I'm excited to learn
about something new and I know I will
just hit the ground running because learn something new and different doing
something I haven't done before it keeps
me going and so I'm excited to learn
more about that area to work in it and
the other thing that comes to come up is
they'll say well you didn't give a great
example to blah blah blah a question
that they asked earlier and so this
gives you a chance to go oh I'm sorry
um could I give you another story
there's actually another example I could
use I actually did this back in college
with a job and ended up getting a better
position than the one they were going to
give me because of my answer it happens
I love this question because it gives
you a chance to fight for the position
normally at the end of the interview
there are areas where they're
questioning you going okay they seem
good overall but I'm not sure about this
or I'm not sure about that and not every
interviewer asks follow-up questions
sometimes they're left wondering those
things by asking this you're giving the
opportunity to clarify anything that's
still leaving them uncertain it also is
an awesome opportunity to show that you
can handle feedback something that so
many people are looking for these days
is someone who can take feedback we are
living in a feedback culture so you need
to be able to handle feedback so this
question shows you can do it and then
like I said even though it'd be kind of
a crappy answer if you get a really
distinct mmm you just don't have this
experience fight for the position make
the argument of why you're great for it
but if it seems kind of like nope
they're not going with you at least now
you have a better idea of where you
stand in the candidate pool and it'll
help you to just pick yourself up keep
moving for the next position so to recap
don't say that you have no questions at
the end be prepared with three questions
including one on culture future success
and that feedback question
and make sure to ask that feedback
question at the end to clarify any
uncertainties so you can make a strong
argument of why you are a great fit for
the position
