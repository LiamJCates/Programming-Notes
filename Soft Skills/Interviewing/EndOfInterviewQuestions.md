You're nearing the end of a job interview, the interviewer asks:
"That's all of our questions do you have any questions for us?"


Do not say "I think you answered everything for me, I think I'm good"
no you have questions, you always have questions

Do not say "what's the next step in this process"
While this

have a couple of questions ready

Types of questions you want to ask

you want to ask questions you genuinely have so when
you're preparing for the interview jot down some questions you have

what are the concerns you have for this position
what do you really want to know

but you want to ask questions that are also showing that you are looking to
succeed in this position, be forward-thinking in your questions

questions around
the culture of the company
people's past successes
challenges in the department

one question I really like is a culture question like tell me about a typical day in this position or I actually really like what's a typical work week like here

because when you ask what the typical day every company the response will be:
"well there's no such thing it's a typical day"
but I digress

but you'll learn about what it's like to work there so it shows that you have
interest in what they do but you're also getting information so you can see can I picture myself in this environment

ask questions that show that you are thinking of what it would take to be successful in this position:

what is it that you would like someone in this position to accomplish in the first 90 days

what is the one trait that you see in people that makes them really successful in this position

how have past employees been successful in this position


Ask about challenges:
it shows that you're not afraid of a challenge as well as okay let me think of how I can problem solve in that challenge
now you're not going to give an answer to that but you want to ask them

what are some of the challenges you foresee in the next six months

it shows once again that you are already trying to figure out how am I going to
do well here how can I do my best for you


try and connect with the interviewer while also getting some idea of the culture:

what made you choose to work here?

what is your favorite part about working for this company or this department?

make sure you're not asking questions that you could Google the answer

I love asking about culture
what's the culture but I ask it about
the department not the company because most companies now you can learn about
their company culture on their LinkedIn page or on their website but you can't
find out about that department so I tend to ask

what's the culture of this department


Always have at least three questions because inevitably one or more will be answered for you during the interview

I try to have 
one that's success driven
one that's culture related
one that's more connecting


the question you have to ask, while scary, is
"Based on what we talked about today, is there anything that would make you hesitant about hiring me for this position?""


they're going to give you an answer
sometimes it's not the answer you want to hear
sometimes it's something directly related to the position
sometimes interviewers are blatantly honest and say well you just don't have these skills so we've had stronger candidates

the beauty of it is you know right away not to be waiting by the phone for their
call you can pick yourself right back up and apply for other positions because you know this one's probably just not it
skills or experience you can't help that you don't have

They might say you don't have a lot of experience in this area
this is now your chance to
make the argument for why you should get
the position anyways this question
allows you the opportunity to fight for
the drop so they say you haven't had a
lot of experience doing XYZ well that is
why I'm so excited to work here I love a
new challenge and I'm excited to learn
about something new and I know I will
just hit the ground running because
learn
something new and different doing
something I haven't done before it keeps
me going and so I'm excited to learn
more about that area to work in it and
the other thing that comes to come up is
they'll say well you didn't give a great
example to blah blah blah a question
that they asked earlier and so this
gives you a chance to go oh I'm sorry
um could I give you another story
there's actually another example I could
use I actually did this back in college
with a job and ended up getting a better
position than the one they were going to
give me because of my answer it happens
I love this question because it gives
you a chance to fight for the position
normally at the end of the interview
there are areas where they're
questioning you going okay they seem
good overall but I'm not sure about this
or I'm not sure about that and not every
interviewer asks follow-up questions
sometimes they're left wondering those
things by asking this you're giving the
opportunity to clarify anything that's
still leaving them uncertain it also is
an awesome opportunity to show that you
can handle feedback something that so
many people are looking for these days
is someone who can take feedback we are
living in a feedback culture so you need
to be able to handle feedback so this
question shows you can do it and then
like I said even though it'd be kind of
a crappy answer if you get a really
distinct mmm you just don't have this
experience fight for the position make
the argument of why you're great for it
but if it seems kind of like nope
they're not going with you at least now
you have a better idea of where you
stand in the candidate pool and it'll
help you to just pick yourself up keep
moving for the next position so to recap
don't say that you have no questions at
the end be prepared with three questions
including one on culture future success
and that feedback question
and make sure to ask that feedback
question at the end to clarify any
uncertainties so you can make a strong
argument of why you are a great fit for
the position
