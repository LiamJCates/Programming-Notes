Why is recursion bad?

Recursion is a technique. It has trade-offs.

Recursion involves repeated function calls, each of which has overhead in both time and stack space compared to an iterative solution.


Many people find recursion confusing, which may make a recursive function harder to document, debug, and maintain.
