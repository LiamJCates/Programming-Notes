DEALING WITH BLEMISHES ON YOUR RECORD OR EXPERIENCE

You can address these issues in your cover letter.

Additionally, consider bringing it up in the interview first before the interviewer asks. This is an advanced negotiation skill where you are in control of how this information is presented. By addressing the elephant in the room, you disarm any personal reservations you subconsciously hold. Alternatively, it could be something the interviewer has in the back of his or her mind, and unless you address it, he or she may not be able to get over it. The best advice in all your communications is to be honest and transparent. Explain the situation. If you made a mistake, explain you made a mistake, but you learned from it. That’s the point that you want to spend more time on. Go into more details on the lessons you learned. What do you know now that you wish you would have back then? You want to keep the focus on establishing that you’re a different person now and you’ve taken steps to improve yourself. You should explicitly guarantee that those same mistakes won’t happen again. These responses will help your prospective employer overcome their initial reservations.
