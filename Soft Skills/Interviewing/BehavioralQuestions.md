BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS
After the HR screening interview, you will have behavioral interviews with the hiring manager and a few other managers in their department. You may even interview with their boss.

During these interviews, you can expect the questions to focus on your historical work experiences in an effort to understand your background and experience to determine if you are the right fit for the job.

No matter who your interviewer is, the first question you will be asked will be, “Tell me about yourself.”

Your answer to these four words will set you up for success if you answer spectacularly. You definitely should memorize your response to this question and practice it over and over again. By starting the interview off with a strong and powerful response, it will give the interviewer comfort and confidence in your communication skills. It also will positively influence his or her first judgment over whether or not you’re a right fit for the role. For this question and all others, you should stick to two or three minutes to give an answer. During your interview preparation, set a timer as you practice to ensure you do not let yourself ramble. You don’t want to go on and on and talk about lots of experiences that are not relevant to the position you are interviewing for. As you craft your answer, make sure you share a story or two about how you’ve overcome challenges to the best of your ability and how you achieved tremendous results. And, of course, how you could do the same for this company.


The second question you are almost guaranteed to be asked is ‘Why are you looking for a job?”

This question is asked whether or not you reached out and applied to the company or through a recruiter, or if the company contacted you directly. It is this question that often trips up interviewees as they have not spent enough time preparing for this specific question. I think most job applicants assume the company knows why they are looking for a job so they do not expect to be asked. However, not providing a well thought out and authentic response to this question may lead to trouble.


A list of additional behavioral questions follows.

For each, insights are provided as to why the company will ask this question.


1. Tell me about a time you had to work with a team.

	The company wants to learn about your collaborative skills. Are you a person that can be immediately inserted into a working team and contribute from day one?


2. Tell me about a time you had to overcome an obstacle.

In this question, the interviewer is testing the level of adversity you have faced and your ability to handle stress. You may want to address this question with a specific project you worked on with a tight deadline.

3. Tell me about a time you had to change plans or strategy when working toward a goal.

Decision making is one of the most important skills employers are hiring for. This question allows the interviewer to learn about how you process risks and rate your project management ability.

4. Tell me about a time you had to work with other departments.

Without communication skills, a professional will not advance in their career. Being able to effectively communicate across departments and seniority levels is crucial to success. Using this question, interviewers want to learn about your experience level and how confident you are talking with, emailing and presenting to others in their organization.

5. Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult colleague.
The work environment can be tumultuous at times, especially
when critical deadlines are at risk of being missed. This question
probes your conflict resolution skills as a leader. The interviewer
wants to understand from your perspective how you address a
negative situation of having a colleague create problems for you
or your team.
6. What is your career goal? Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Normally, one of the last questions you can expect to be asked is
about how your short and medium term career outlook. The
interviewer is interested in learning your personal assessment of
self-worth and how ambitious you are in your career. Irecommend as part of your research that you identify a position
in the company at least two levels above the role you are
interviewing for.
My favorite quote of all time is “The true measure of a person is determined
not during times of comfort and convenience, but instead during times of
challenge and controversy,” by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The best job
candidates are those that can handle the pressure of being challenged during
the interview. In this chapter I’ve shared with you valuable knowledge that
will prepare you to overcome challenges and have a great interview.
