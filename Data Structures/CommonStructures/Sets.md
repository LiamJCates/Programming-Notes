Bag (Multiset)
Generalization of the notion of a set collection allowing the indiscriminate (nonunique) item insertion and order, removing items unsupported

Unordered
Nonunique

In mathematics, a multiset (aka bag or mset) is a modification of the concept of a set
unlike a set, bags allows for multiple instances for each of its elements.
The number of instances, given for each element is called the multiplicity of this element in the multiset.
As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist, which contain only elements a and b, but vary by the multiplicity of their elements:

    The multiset {a, b} contains only elements a and b, each having multiplicity 1.
    In multiset {a, a, b}, the element a has multiplicity 2, and b has multiplicity 1.

As with sets, and in contrast to tuples, order does not matter in discriminating multisets, so {a, a, b} and {a, b, a} denote the same multiset.


A bag is a collection where removing items is not supportedâ€”its purpose is to provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items). The order of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client.

public class Bag<Item> implements Iterable<Item>
Bag()                 //create an empty bag            O(1)
void add(Item item)         //add an item                O(1)
boolean isEmpty()         //is the bag empty?            O(1)
int size()             //number of items in the bag        O(1)

With our Bag API, a client can add items to a bag and process them all with a foreach statement whenever needed.
