## Doubly Linked List

In a doubly linked list, each element has a link to the previous element in the list as well as to the next element in the list. This additional link makes it possible to traverse the list in either direction. The entire list can be traversed starting from any element. A doubly linked list has head and tail elements just like a singly linked list. The head of the list has an empty or null previous link, just as the tail of the list has a null or empty next link.
