Binary Tree:
A tree in which all nodes have at most two child nodes.

A binary tree is the simplest form of a tree. A binary tree consists of a
root node and two subtrees known as the left subtree and the right subtree,
where both subtrees are also binary trees.

Binary search tree:     (Unique, Ordered binary tree)
Binary Tree  in which there are no duplicate nodes and in which all nodes are arranged in a sorted order


Each Binary Tree node has three components
A Data Element
A Left Tree Link
A Right Tree Link


A binary tree is a hierchical data structure in which each node has at most
two children, that is, a left and right child. In a binary tree, the degree of each node can be at most two. A binary tree is a popular subtype of a k-ary tree, where k is 2..


Binary Search Tree BST

Binary trees are used to implement binary search trees, which are used for efficient searching and sorting. A variation of BST is an AVL tree where height of left and right sub tree differs by one .
