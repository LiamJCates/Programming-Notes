While every node in a binary search tree contains three parts, that is, an information part and two pointers LEFT and RIGHT which point to the left and
right subtrees.

A Multiway search tree is a tree which contains (M – 1) values per node. It also
has M subtrees. In an M-way search tree, M is called the degree of the
node. For example, if the value of M = 3 in an M-way search tree, then
the tree will contain two values per node and it will have three subtrees.
When an M-way search tree is not empty, it has the following properties:
1. Each node in an M-way search tree is of the following structure:

n | P0 | K0 | P1 | K1 | P2 | K2 _ _ _ _ _ _ Pn-1 | Kn-1 | Pn |

where
P0, P1, P2, . . . Pn are the pointers to the node’s subtrees
K0, K1, K2, . . . Kn are the key values stored in the node.

2. The key values in a node are stored in ascending order, that is, Ki < Ki+1,
where i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n-2.

3. All the key values stored in the left subtree are always less than the root
node.

4. All the key values stored in the right subtree are always greater than the root node.

5. The subtrees pointed to by Pi for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n are also M-way search trees.
