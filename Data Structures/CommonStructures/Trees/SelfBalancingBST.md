A self-balancing binary search tree (BST) automatically keeps its nodes arranged so as to minimize the height of the tree. The height of a binary search tree is the distance from the root node to the furthest leaf node in the tree. Keeping the height of a BST small also minimizes the time it takes to perform operations on the tree. The automatic balancing of a BST can take a signifi cant amount of time, so not all implementations are strict about minimizing height, tolerating some deviation in the interest of performance. Two popular implementations of self-balancing BSTs are red-black tree and AVL tree.
