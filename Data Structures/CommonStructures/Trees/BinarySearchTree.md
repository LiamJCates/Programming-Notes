Binary Search Tree BST

Binary trees are used to implement binary search trees, which are used for efficient searching and sorting.

The data stored at each BST node has a distinguished key which is unique in the tree and belongs to a total order

Typically this ordering places nodes in the left subtree that have a value less than that of the root node. Similarly, all the nodes in the right subtree have a value more than that of the root node.

The binary search tree is also known as an ordered binary tree

The left and the right subtrees are also binary search trees, and thus the same property is applicable on every subtree in the binary search tree.


each of the subtrees is ordered. Thus, it becomes easier to
search for an element in the tree, and as a result, time is also reduced by
a great margin.
