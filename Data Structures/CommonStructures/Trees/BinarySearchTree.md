Binary Search Tree BST

Binary trees are often used to implement binary search trees

In addition to the properties satisfied by binary trees, binary search trees are unique, ordered structures that support efficient searching.
	The uniqueness property is satisfied by the data stored at each BST node having a distinguished key which is unique in the tree
	The ordered property is satisfied by the key values which belong to a total order.

The binary search tree is also known as an ordered binary tree. Typically this ordering places nodes in the left subtree that have a key value less than that of the root node. Similarly, all the nodes in the right subtree have a key value more than that of the root node.

Binary Search Tree structures matches that of a standard binary tree, see:
