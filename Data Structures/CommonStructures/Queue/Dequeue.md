De-queues (Double-Ended Queues)
A double-ended queue (de-queue, pronounced “deck”) is a special type
of data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements is done at either end, that is, either at the front end or at the rear end of the queue. It is
often called a head-tail linked list because elements are added or removed
from either the head (front) end or tail (end).


There are two types of double-ended queues, which include:
1. Input Restricted De-Queue – In this, the deletion operation can be
performed at both ends (i.e., both front and rear end) while the insertion operation can be performed only at one end (i.e., rear end).

2. Output Restricted De-Queue – In this, the insertion operation can be
performed at both ends while the deletion operation can be performed
only at one end (i.e., front end).
