# Arrays



An array is a contiguous collection of same typed data<br/>
The members of an array collection are called elements
<br/><br/>
Properties of arrays are its capacity, type, and size:
* Capacity is generally the number of items that the array can potentially store
* Type specifies the type of items stored by an array, the type of these items determines the memory space needed by each individual array member
* Array size is the size of an array in memory and it determined by the capacity * item memory size

Operations

Insert
Adds an element at kth position
Value can be stored in array at Kth position in O(1) constant time. We just need to store value at arr[k].


Access
Reading the value stored at kth position.
Accessing value stored a some location in array is also O(1) constant time. We just need to read value stored at arr[k].
