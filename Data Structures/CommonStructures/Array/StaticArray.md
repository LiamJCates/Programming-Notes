## Static Array

A static array has a fixed capacity that must be known at time of array instantiation and are thus also known as fixed-capacity or fixed-size arrays.

Most languages have a built in


Advantages of simple arrays
1. Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations; hence, searching is
very fast, as any element can be easily accessed.

2. Static arrays do not support dynamic memory allocation, so all the memory
management is done by the system.

Limitations of simple arrays
1. Insertion and deletion of elements in arrays is complicated and very time-consuming, as it requires the shifting of elements.

2. Arrays are static; hence, the size must be known in advance.
