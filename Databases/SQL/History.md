The relational database was first conceived in 1969 and has arguably
become the most widely used database model in database management

The father of the relational model, Dr. Edgar F. Codd (1923–2003),
was an IBM research scientist in the late 1960s and was at that time
looking into new ways to handle large amounts of data.

Dr. Codd formally presented his new relational model in a landmark
work titled “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Databanks” in
June 1970.1 He based his new model on two branches of mathematics—
set theory and first-order predicate logic. Indeed, the name of the model
itself is derived from the term relation, which is part of set theory.

A pair of IBM researchers first outlined the syntax for SQL (then called SEQUEL) in a 1974 paper, building on the theoretical work of the British computer scientist EdgarF.  Codd.  

In  1979,  a  precursor  to  the  database  company  Oracle  (then called  Relational  Software)  became  the  first  to  use  the  language  in a commercial product.



In the earliest days of the relational database, RDBMSs were written for
use on mainframe computers. Two RDBMS programs prevalent in the early
1970s were System R, developed by IBM at its San Jose Research Laboratory in California, and Interactive Graphics Retrieval System (INGRES),
developed at the University of California at Berkeley. These two programs
contributed greatly to the general appreciation of the relational model.
As the benefits of the relational database became more widely known,
many companies decided to make a slow move from hierarchical and
network database models to the relational database model, thus creating
a need for more and better mainframe RDBMS programs. The 1980s saw
the development of various commercial RDBMSs for mainframe computers by companies such as Oracle and IBM.
The early to mid-1980s saw the rise of the personal computer, and
with it, the development of PC-based RDBMS programs. Some of the
early entries in this category, from companies such as Ashton-Tate and
Fox Software, were nothing more than elementary file-based databasemanagement systems. True PC-based RDBMS programs began to emerge
with products developed by companies such as Microrim and Ansa
Software. These companies helped to spread the idea and potential of
database management from the mainframe-dominated domain of information systems departments to the desktop of the common end user.
The need to share data became apparent as more and more users
worked with databases throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. The
concept of a centrally located database that could be made available to
multiple users seemed a very promising idea. This would certainly make
data management and database security much easier to implement.
Database vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle responded to this need
by developing client/server RDBMS programs.
The manner in which databases are used evolved immensely over the
years, and many organizations began to realize that a lot of useful
information could be gathered from data they stored in various relational and nonrelational databases. This prompted them to question
whether there was a way to mine the data for useful analytical information that they could then use to make critical business decisions.


Furthermore, they wondered whether they could consolidate and integrate their data into a viable knowledgebase for their organizations.
Indeed, these would be difficult questions to answer.
IBM proposed the idea of a data warehouse, which, as originally conceived, would enable organizations to access data stored in any number of nonrelational databases. It was unsuccessful in its first attempts
at implementing data warehouses, primarily because of the complexities
and performance problems associated with such a task. Only since the
1990s has the implementation of data warehouses become more viable
and practical. William H. (Bill) Inmon, widely regarded as the father of
the data warehouse, is a strong and vocal advocate of the technology
and has been instrumental in its evolution. Data warehouses are now
more commonplace as companies move to leverage the vast amounts of
data they’ve stored in their databases over the years.
The Internet has had a significant impact on the way organizations use
databases. Many companies and businesses use the Web to expand
their consumer base, and much of the data they share with and gather
from these consumers is stored in a database. Developers commonly use
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to assemble and consolidate data
from various relational and nonrelational systems.
There has been a considerable effort by various vendors to get their clients to create databases and store data in the “cloud”; that is, a location that is completely apart from the client’s location. The idea is that
the client can access data from the cloud database via the Internet from
anywhere at any time. As an example of using the “cloud” for database
management, Microsoft’s focus in the last several releases of Microsoft
Access has been to migrate data from desktop devices to cloud servers.
Given the broad emergence and use of connected devices within the past
several years (as of this writing), it will be interesting to see how database management systems evolve within this type of environment.
