Structured Query Language (SQL): Is a special purpose programming language to manipulate data sets


SQL comes in several variants, which are generally tied to specific database systems. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which set standards for products and technologies, provide standards for the language and shepherd revisions to it. The good news is that the variants don’t stray far from the standard, so once you learn the SQL conventions for one database, you can transfer that knowledge to other systems.

A database implementation must encompass the functionality set forth by these standards

Many database system implementations include additional features


Why Use SQL?
SQL is not usually the first tool people choose when they’re learning to analyze data. In fact, many people start with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and their assortment of analytic functions. After working with Excel, they might graduate to Access, the database system built into Microsoft Office, which has a graphical query interface that makes it easy to get work done, making SQL skills optional. But as you might know, Excel and Access have their limits. Excel currently allows 1,048,576 rows maximum per worksheet, and Access limits database size to two gigabytes and limits columns to 255 per table.

Using a robust SQL database system allows you to work with terabytes of data, multiple related tables, and thousands of columns. It gives you improved programmatic control over the structure of your data, leading to efficiency, speed, and—most important—accuracy.



Advantages of SQL
SQL is not proprietary or used by specific database vendors.
Nearly all major DBMS supports SQL, so learning it enables interaction with nearly every database.

SQL is easy to learn as statements are all made up of descriptive English words
there aren’t that many keywords

Despite a simplistic grammar, SQL is actually a very powerful language, performing complex and sophisticated database operations.
