a statement is a complete "something" that a database engine can understand and produce a result set for.

Statements may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.

SQL statements also include the semicolon ";" statement terminator.
Most DBMSs do not require that a semicolon be specified after single statements
Multiple SQL statements must be separated by semicolons
Though not required on every platform, the semicolon statement terminator is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.





Every SQL statement can be broken down into individual tokens called keywords and identifiers

SQL statements are categorized into five different types of statements:

	DDL (DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE)
	DML (DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)
  DQL (DATA QUERY LANGUAGE)  
  DCL (DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)
  TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE)
