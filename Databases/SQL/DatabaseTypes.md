Generally, two types of databases are used in database management:
operational databases and analytical databases.


### operational databases
Operational databases are the backbone of many companies, organizations, and institutions throughout the world today. This type of database
is primarily used to collect, modify, and maintain data on a day-to-day
basis. The type of data stored is dynamic, meaning that it changes constantly and always reflects up-to-the-minute information. Organizations
such as retail stores, manufacturing companies, hospitals and clinics,
and publishing houses use operational databases because their data is
in a constant state of flux.


### analytical databases
In contrast, an analytical database stores and tracks historical and
time-dependent data. It is a valuable asset for tracking trends, viewing
statistical data over a long period, or making tactical or strategic business projections. The type of data stored is static, meaning that the
data is never (or very rarely) modified, although new data might often be
added. The information gleaned from an analytical database reflects a
point-in-time snapshot of the data and is usually not up to date. Chemical labs, geological companies, and marketing analysis firms are examples of organizations that use analytical databases. Note that the data
found in analytical databases is usually gleaned from an operational
database. For example, sales history each month might be summarized
and saved in an analytical database.





The subject that a given table represents can be either an object or an
event. When the subject is an object, the table represents something
that is tangible, such as a person, place, or thing. Regardless of its type,
every object has characteristics that can be stored as data.

When the subject of a table is an event, the table represents something
that occurs at a given point in time and has characteristics you wish to
record. These characteristics can be stored as data and then processed
as information in the same manner as a table that represents some specific object.
