The ECMAScript language Algorithms manipulate values each of which has an associated type.

JavaScript's types are:
  Number
  String
  Boolean
  Symbol (new in ES2015)
  Object
    Function
    Array
    Date
    RegExp
  null
  undefined
  Error



JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language.

JavaScript is “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

Like almost every dynamic language, JavaScript is a "duck-typed" language, and therefore every variable is defined using the var keyword, and can contain all types of variables.

Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.



We can define several types of variables to use in our code:

var myNumber = 3;                   // a number
var myString = "Hello, World!";     // a string
var myBoolean = true;               // a boolean

A few notes about variable types in JavaScript:

    In JavaScript, the Number type can be both a floating point number and an integer.
    Boolean variables can only be equal to either true or false.

There are two more advanced types in JavaScript. An array, and an object. We will get to them in more advanced tutorials.

var myArray = [];                    // an array
var myObject = {};                  // an object
