JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.


JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
