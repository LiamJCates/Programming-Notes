Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object. They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using [] syntax) but they have one magic property called 'length'. This is always one more than the highest index in the array.

One way of creating arrays is as follows:

var a = new Array();
a[0] = 'dog';
a[1] = 'cat';
a[2] = 'hen';
a.length; // 3

A more convenient notation is to use an array literal:

var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
a.length; // 3

Note that array.length isn't necessarily the number of items in the array. Consider the following:

var a = ['dog', 'cat', 'hen'];
a[100] = 'fox';
a.length; // 101

Remember — the length of the array is one more than the highest index.

If you query a non-existent array index, you'll get a value of undefined in return:

typeof a[90]; // undefined

If you take the above about [] and length into account, you can iterate over an array using the following for loop:

for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  // Do something with a[i]
}

ES2015 introduced the more concise for...of loop for iterable objects such as arrays:

for (const currentValue of a) {
  // Do something with currentValue
}

You could also iterate over an array using a for...in loop, however this does not iterate over the array elements, but the array indices. Furthermore, if someone added new properties to Array.prototype, they would also be iterated over by such a loop. Therefore this loop type is not recommended for arrays.

Another way of iterating over an array that was added with ECMAScript 5 is forEach():

['dog', 'cat', 'hen'].forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
  // Do something with currentValue or array[index]
});

If you want to append an item to an array do it like this:

a.push(item);

Arrays come with a number of methods. See also the full documentation for array methods:

|Method name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| a.toString() | Returns a string with the toString() of each element separated by commas. |
| a.toLocaleString() | Returns a string with the toLocaleString() of each element separated by commas. |
| a.concat(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]]) | Returns a new array with the items added on to it. |
| a.join(sep) | Converts the array to a string — with values delimited by the sep param |
| a.pop() | Removes and returns the last item. |
| a.push(item1, ..., itemN) | Appends items to the end of the array. |
| a.shift() | Removes and returns the first item. |
| a.unshift(item1[, item2[, ...[, itemN]]]) | Prepends items to the start of the array. |
| a.slice(start[, end]) | Returns a sub-array. |
| a.sort([cmpfn]) | Takes an optional comparison function. |
| a.splice(start, delcount[, item1[, ...[, itemN]]]) | Lets you modify an array by deleting a section and replacing it with more items. |
| a.reverse() | Reverses the array.
