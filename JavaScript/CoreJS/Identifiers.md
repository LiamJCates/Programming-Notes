Identifiers

To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or variable

In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter

### Keywords

Keywords are reserved words in JavaScript that you cannot use to indicate variable labels or function names. There are a total of 63 keywords that JavaScript provides to programmers. All of them are shown in the below-mentioned table:

You can't use a keyword as an identifier in your JavaScript programs, its reserved words, and used to perform an internal operation.
