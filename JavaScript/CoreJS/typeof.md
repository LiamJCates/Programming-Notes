typeof operator 

The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. Itâ€™s useful when we want to process
values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.
It supports two forms of syntax:
1. As an operator: typeof x .
2. As a function: typeof(x) .
In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.
