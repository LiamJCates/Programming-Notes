history of JavaScript.

It all started in the few years before 1995 when the Netscape Navigator web browser was being developed by the company Netscape Communications.  Netscape was very popular in the '90s and dominated the browser market. The founder of Netscape Communications believed that HTML needed a glue language that was easy to use by web designers.

1995     Netscape hired Brendan Eich to integrate the Scheme programming language into Netscape Navigator.
He created a prototype of what was called LiveScript.
When the first version shipped with Netscape Navigator, was renamed JavaScript.
As Netscape just closed a deal with Sun to incorporate Java in their products, JavaScript was positioned as the lightweight scripting language for the web that complements the Java programming language, which you'd use for more robust tasks.
However, JavaScript just looks a little bit like Java, but its implementation is more like a combination of the programming languages Scheme and Self.
Soon after JavaScript released in Netscape Navigator, Netscape introduced a serverâ€‘side implementation of JavaScript that worked with Netscape Enterprise Server.
On the other side of the camp, Microsoft also included scripting languages in their browser, Internet Explorer. They used JScript and VBScript to do similar things to JavaScript as Internet Explorer and Netscape had different implementations creating websites that would run on both browsers was difficult.

1996    websites popped up with messages like this website is best viewed using Netscape.
Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to create a standard specification, just like the standards for HTML and CSS.

1997    First official standard, called ECMAScript
was implemented by JavaScript, as well as languages like ActionScript and JScript.
1998    standard evolved with more features into ECMAScript 2
1999    ECMAScript version 3
2000    work started on ECMAScript 4,
2004     ECMAScrit standard scrapped


2007    ECMAScript evolved to version 3.1 to oppose the version 4 effort.
2008    everybody with different implementations, like JScript, came together to further the development of the standard.
2009    rename of ECMAScript version 3.1 to version 5
2011     ECMAScript 5.1.
2015    the standard was called ECMAScript 2015 and evolved into 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 with a lot of new features and paradigms.

Nowadays, almost all the major browsers implement the ECMAScript standard and often offer more functionality than just the standard. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript. You can find implementations of JavaScript everywhere. It runs in web browsers, on your mobile devices, and server side in implementations like Node.js.
