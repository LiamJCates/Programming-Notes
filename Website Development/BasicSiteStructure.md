Basic Website structure


The most common things we'll have on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders to contain images, style files, and script files. Let's create these now:

index.html: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your test-site folder.

images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder.

styles folder: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called styles, inside your test-site folder.

scripts folder: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). Create a folder called scripts, inside your test-site folder.
