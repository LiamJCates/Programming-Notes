Why Learn About HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

The web works because of the internet. Magic happens when a web browser asks for a document by a URL and a web server returns it through the HTTP protocol. All of that stuff is infrastructure. Very interesting, but abstracted for developers and software architects.

The magic that happens in the web browser is where we focus.

Content is structured in an HTML document, is formatted and styled with CSS, and gets functionality from JavaScript.


The most important technologies that make the web work are HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript.
Any website that you visit today consists out of these three technologies.

It is important to remember that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or ECMAScript are standards that describe functionalities. They don't do much by themselves.

These standards are implemented in web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
The web browser is the one that determines how it interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML documents contain the content of a web page.
This is often text with images, and sometimes richer media like audio and video.
HTML has lots of elements to display content, and also has elements that lets users interact with content.

HTML can contain links, links to sections in the HTML document and links to other documents. This is the way the web works.
Everything has a unique address, a unique URL, and pages linked to each other to get from one page to the other.

You can use CSS to style HTML.
CSS can change the look and feel of HTML, like its color or font. You can write CSS in files that you reference from your HTML documents. When you do that, your CSS styles become reusable and your HTML becomes more readable and maintainable as you separate style from content. CSS has evolved to have advanced styling mechanisms.

JavaScript is the glue of the web.
You can use it to interact with HTML, with a browser, and even with services and APIs, all without refreshing the page. JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, but web browsers are not the only ones that can interpret and run it. There are also server-side implementations of JavaScript, like Node. js. If you want to learn how to develop applications for the web, you need to learn to program in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
