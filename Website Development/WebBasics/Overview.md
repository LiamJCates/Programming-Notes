The web works by displaying HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding interaction with JavaScript.

How the Magic of the Web Works

The Internet: is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.

World Wide Web: an open information system populated with resources reached through URLs.

Unique Resource Locators: (URLs) provide unique addresses to those resources so that your browser can access them

Package switching: the technique for dividing information into message blocks that each get routed separately, and assembled on the other side. The distributed nature and error correction allowed by packet switching make communication across the internet possible.


The HTTP protocol takes care of the information communication between the web browser and the web server to deliver documents so that the web browser can render it on the screen.



Big Idea:
The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Unique Resource Locators, or URLs, interlinked by hypertext links and can be accessed by the internet.

web basic ingredients:
  resources, like HTML documents, images, or other files. This is the content that we want to use, websites that we want to browse, images to look at, files that we want to share.
  URLs. These uniquely identify the resources so that your web browser can ultimately show them to you or download them. Every resource on the web has a unique URL.
  Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. This is the communication protocol that defines how documents are transferred between networked devices.

How it works:
  Documents, like HTML documents and other resources like images, are hosted by web servers.
  Web servers are computers that run special software to serve up documents and other resources.
  The web server will have a unique address on the internet, a URL.
  Example:     server.com
  All resources hosted by a given server will have unique names related to that server
  Example:     server.com/document1.html.
  You can use these resources from a client computer that has a web browser installed on it, like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.
  Nowadays, there are many types of client PCs that have web browsers, desktop computers, mobile phones or even virtual reality headsets.


Web browsers use the HTTP GET operation to ask the internet to serve up a specific document that lives at the address of a given URL.
Whilst rendering an HTML document on the screen, a web browser uses CSS and JavaScript to style the document and give it functionality.
A web browser doesn't only get documents from a server, sometimes it sends documents back to the server for processing using an HTTP POST operation.

Now this is a very simplified view of how the web works. There is much more going on, like domain name server calls and TCP/IP protocol handshakes, but that is beyond the scope of this document
