Another common attribute is ID And you can also use name.
\<p id="p1" name="p1n"\>
They don't have to be the same, but they can be.
A class can be uses on many different elements in the same page because it's a class of item.
Whereas the ID should be unique, elements should have unique IDs and unique names
ID and name would be unique on a particular element and those are often used with style sheets, as well as when we get into programming with JavaScript to identify a very particular element on the page that we want to do something with.
