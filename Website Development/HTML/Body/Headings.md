Headings generally denote different sections of your document.
We have different levels of headings from H1 to H6.

H1 is highest level heading, the heading for the document, have one H1 per page.
And this gets used by certain tools as they look at your page to understand what the core content of the page is. 

The other levels you can use to segment your content into different sections and different hierarchies. These headings get rendered usually as a single line of text and with varying levels of font size and boldness or emphasis based on the level of the heading.
