HTML TIMELINE
1990         HTML specified, web browser and the World Wide Web created

1993        official draft proposal of an HTML specification by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

early 1994    Internet Engineering Task Force created HTML 2.0 specification
HTML 2.0 became the standard for web browsers.

Jan 1997    HTML 3. 2 specification proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

Dec 1997    W3C published a recommendation for HTML 4. 0.

1999         revision called HTML 4. 01 was published by the W3C.

aside from drafts and minor versions, no new versions were published for a long time

2014         HTML5 published by W3C
developed by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

2016        W3C delivered HTML 5. 1
2017        W3C delivered HTML 5. 2.


As you can see, developing a specification and evolving it is hard and time consuming.
You've heard about several taskforces and organizations involved in the evolution of HTML.
So, who manages the HTML specification?

1990        inventor of the World Wide Web and the web browser, Tim Berners-Lee
came up with the first specification of HTML, the first elements that it consisted of.

This wasn't a standard yet.

1993        Internet Engineering Task Force proposed the first official specification
This is a United States-based group that creates internet standards
Were heavily involved in the TCP/IP standard.
Oct 1994    The W3C founded by Tim Berners-Lee
1996        World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, maintains the HTML specification hereafter, with input from commercial software vendors.

2000 HTML officially became an international standard, registered with the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electronical Commission.
2004, a new group founded by people from Mozilla, Apple, and Opera was formed. This group was called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. This group formed in response to the slow development of web standards by the W3C. The group started working on HTML 5. 0, which was adopted by the W3C as the way forward and became a joint deliverable of the W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. HTML5 is now considered a living standard. Some say that there will never be a 6. 0 version of HTML, as HTML5 or the living HTML standard will just be evolved to have new features.
