1994    CSS was first proposed as a style sheet language.

Other languages were also being proposed at the time. However, the W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium, who were already working on the HTML standard, added CSS to the deliverables of the HTML working group.

1996    official recommendation of the CSS level 1 standard (CSS1)

Such a recommendation is considered a specification that web browsers can adopt, which they did, although in the beginning there was very little support for CSS in the major browsers.

1998    publication of the CSS level 2 recommendation

After that, a lot of time went by before there were any official new versions of the standard, although browser support became better and better.

2004    CSS level 2.1 became a candidate recommendation published by the W3C.

The level 2.1 recommendation ping‑ponged back and forth between candidate recommendation and working draft until it was finally published as an official recommendation

2011    actual specification of CSS

In the meantime, work on the next level of CSS had already begun. This new level was CSS level 3 and wasn't going to be one all‑encompassing recommendation, but rather an ever‑evolving collection of CSS modules that each described a category of capabilities. This resulted in the publication of the standard recommendation for a couple of CSS level 3 modules, including the CSS3 selectors and CSS3 colors module.

2012    Official recommendations for more CSS3 modules emerged, like the CSS3 mediaqueries module

2017    CSS3 UI module

Future developments of the CSS specification follows the module principle where some modules reach level 4 and new modules are introduced as level 1 modules. It is important to remember that these versions all contain different capabilities of CSS and are all determined by commissions like the World Wide Web Consortium. This results in standards that are agreed upon capabilities that only work because web browsers implements them.
