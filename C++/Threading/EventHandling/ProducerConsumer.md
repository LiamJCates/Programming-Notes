A common design pattern in concurrent programming is the producer-consumer architecture, where one or more threads or processes act as a producer, which adds elements to some shared data structure, and one or more other threads act as a consumer, which removes items from that structure and does something with them.

In a basic example, the produce threads add data to a queue type data structure and the consumers remove elements from the queue.

Queues operate on a principle called a first-in-first-out, or FIFO, which means items are removed in the same order that they're put into the queue. The first item that was added will be the first item to be removed. The consumer will remvoe the data element that has been in the queue the longest.

Now, when multiple threads are operating in this type of producer-consumer situation, it poses several challenges for synchronization.

First off, the queue is a shared resource, so we'll need something to enforce mutual exclusion and make sure that only one thread can use it at a time to add or remove items.

We also need to make sure that the producer will not try to add data to the queue when it's full and that the consumer won't try to remove data from an empty buffer.

Some programming languages may include implementations of a queue that's considered thread safe and handles all of these challenges under the hood, so you don't have to. But if your language does not include that support, then you can use the combination of a mutex and condition variables to implement your own thread-safe, synchronized queue.

You may run into scenarios where the producer cannot be paused if the queue fills up. The producer might be an external source of streaming data that you can't slow down, so it's important to consider the rate at which items are produced and consumed from the queue. If the consumer can't keep up with production, then we face a buffer overflow, and we'll lose data.

Some programming languages offer implementations of unbounded queues, which are implemented using linked lists to have an advertised unlimited capacity. But keep in mind, even those will be limited by the amount of physical memory in the computer.

The rate at which the producer is adding items may not always be consistent. For example, in network applications, data might arrive in bursts of network packets, which fill the queue quickly. But if those bursts occur rather infrequently, the consumer has time to catch up between bursts. You should consider the average rate at which items are produced and consumed. You want the average rate of production to be less than the average rate of consumption.

A pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements arranged so that the output of each element is the input to the next one. It's basically a series of producer-consumer pairs. Each member of the chain is connected together with some sort of buffer, like a queue, that manages the flow of data elements between between them.

In a pipeline, some initial producer passes data elements to a queue, the first producer/consumer removes elements from that queue, does some processing, then passes the transformed elements along to another queue.

The next producer/consumer removes from that queue then does some processing to either complete the pipeline with some final transformation or passes along the data to the next queue in the chain.

If each producer/consumer is handled by threads that execute in parallel, then as a pipeline they are processing as many elements as there are threads at any given moment.

If the producer/consumers are not synchronized, the issue of processing rate is still a concern. Each thread needs to be able to consume and process data faster than the elements upstream can produce it.



### Producer-Consumer Example

```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <queue>

class ServingLine {
    public:
        void serve_soup(int i) {
            soup_queue.push(i);
        }

        int take_soup() {
            int bowl = soup_queue.front();
            soup_queue.pop();
            return bowl;
        }

    private:
        std::queue<int> soup_queue;
};

ServingLine serving_line = ServingLine();

void soup_producer() {
    for (int i=0; i<1000000; i++) { // serve a 10,000 bowls of soup
        serving_line.serve_soup(1);
    }
    serving_line.serve_soup(-1); // indicate no more soup
    printf("Producer is done serving soup!\n");
}

void soup_consumer() {
    int soup_eaten = 0;
    while (true) {
        int bowl = serving_line.take_soup();
        if (bowl == -1) { // check for last bowl of soup
            printf("Consumer ate %d bowls of soup.\n", soup_eaten);
            serving_line.serve_soup(-1); // put back last bowl for other consumers to take
            return;
        } else {
            soup_eaten += bowl; // eat the soup
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread olivia(soup_producer);
    std::thread barron(soup_consumer);
    std::thread steve(soup_consumer);
    olivia.join();
    barron.join();
    steve.join();
}
```

To demonstrate a producer-consumer scenario with C++, we've defined a custom class on line seven named ServingLine to pass virtual bowls of soup between our threads.

The ServingLine instantiates a queue from the C++ standard library on line 20, which provides basic first in first out or FIFO queue capability.

The serve_soup function on line nine simply pushes a new bowl of soup under the queue

The take_soup function on line 13 removes the first bowl of soup from the queue and returns its value.

We're simply using integers here to represent the bowls of soup.

On line 23, we instantiate a global serving_line variable for all of our threads to interact with.
On line 25, we define the soup_producer function. It uses a for loop to serve 10,000 bowls of soup, which are represented by the integer value one. Then, after the for loop, it places a negative one into the serving queue on line 30, which is a simple way to indicate to the consumer threads that the producer is done serving soup.
Finally, the producer prints a message that it's done serving soup before exiting.

On line 33, the soup_consumer instantiates a local variable to keep track of how many bowls of soup it eats, and then uses a while loop to continuously take bowls from the serving line. It calls the take_soup function on line 36 to take the next bowl of soup and then checks to see if its value is negative one, indicating the last bowl. If so, it prints a message saying how much soup it ate, it puts the negative one back into the serving line in case another consumer thread needs to see it as well and then exits.
If the bowl the consumer took was not the negative one indicator, then it adds the bowl's value to the soup_eaten counter on line 42 before looping back around to take another one.

Finally, down in the program's main function, we simply start a single producer thread named Olivia and two consumers named Baron and Steve to serve and eat soup respectively.

If we run this program it errors out with a stack dump. We're running into problems here because the C++ standard library queue is not thread-safe, meaning it does not have any built-in mechanisms to protect it from data races and other problems when multiple threads are pushing and popping items on and off of it.



```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <queue>
//Add necessary headers
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

class ServingLine {
    public:
				//Add lock, unlock and notify
        void serve_soup(int i) {
					std::unique_lock<std::mutex> ladle_lock(ladle);
          soup_queue.push(i);
					ladle_lock.unlock();
					soup_served.notify_one();
        }

        int take_soup() {
					std::unique_lock<std::mutex> ladle_lock(ladle);
					while(soup_queue.empty())
					{
						soup_served.wait(ladle_lock);
					}
            int bowl = soup_queue.front();
            soup_queue.pop();
            return bowl;
        }

    private:
        std::queue<int> soup_queue;
				//Add mutex and condition variable objects
				std::mutex ladle;
				std::condition_variable soup_served;
};

ServingLine serving_line = ServingLine();

void soup_producer() {
    for (int i=0; i<1000000; i++) { // serve a 10,000 bowls of soup
        serving_line.serve_soup(1);
    }
    serving_line.serve_soup(-1); // indicate no more soup
    printf("Producer is done serving soup!\n");
}

void soup_consumer() {
    int soup_eaten = 0;
    while (true) {
        int bowl = serving_line.take_soup();
        if (bowl == -1) { // check for last bowl of soup
            printf("Consumer ate %d bowls of soup.\n", soup_eaten);
            serving_line.serve_soup(-1); // put back last bowl for other consumers to take
            return;
        } else {
            soup_eaten += bowl; // eat the soup
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread olivia(soup_producer);
    std::thread barron(soup_consumer);
    std::thread steve(soup_consumer);
    olivia.join();
    barron.join();
    steve.join();
}
```
Output:
```
Producer is done serving soup!
Consumer ate 497610 bowls of soup.
Consumer ate 502390 bowls of soup.
```

So let's create our own thread-safe queue class by modifying the serving line.

To do that, I'll include the mutex and condition variable headers up top.
Then I'll instantiate to more private members in the ServingLine class, a mutex which I'll name after the ladle used to serve soup, and then a condition variable, which we'll use to signal when a new bowl of soup is served.

Now, up in the serve_soup function before pushing a bowl under the soup queue at line 12, let's protect it by instantiating a unique lock object using the ladle mutex. Then after pushing soup onto the queue, we're done with the critical section so we'll unlock the ladle to make it available for another thread to take. Then, we'll notify a consumer thread waiting on the soup_served condition variable to let them know that soup was served.

To fix up the take_soup function on line 18 for the consumer threads. We'll start by creating a unique lock under ladle mutex similar to what we did in the serve_soup function. Then, we'll use a while loop to wait while the soup queue is empty because there's nothing to take. If the queue is empty, we'll use the condition variable's wait function to release the ladle lock and wait here until another producer thread adds soup to the queue and then uses the notify_one function on line 15 to let us know that there's soup ready to take.

I'd like to point out here that we're using a unique_lock in the serve_soup and take_soup functions instead of other types of C++ locks like lock_guard or scoped_lock because the condition variable's wait function only accepts a unique_lock which can be unlocked and then relocked later to transfer ownership between threads. 

We build the program and then run it. And it works. We get messages from the two consumer threads that ate different amounts of soup and together, they consumed the total 10,000 bowls of soup that were served up by the producer thread.


Now, you might be wondering why the C++ standard queue isn't thread-safe by default. After all, other languages like Java and Python include thread-safe queues as part of their standard libraries. C++ gives you the basic building blocks to implement exactly what you need. If you were using a queue for a single-threaded application, then you would not want the additional overhead that comes with including a mutex and condition variable, but we needed those mechanisms in place for our scenario, and fortunately, it wasn't too difficult to create our own thread-safe ServingLine class. If you're not in the mood to write your own version of a queue class, then we recommend checking out the boost C++ libraries, which include this thread-safe queue to use with multiple readers and writers.
