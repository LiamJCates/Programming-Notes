To permit more complex statements, C++ provides a structure called a compound statement, also called a block or block statement. A compound statement is a group of zero or more statements that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement. In C++, such statements are a sequence of statements delimited by curly braces {...}. Blocks can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. No semicolon is needed at the end of a block.

Compound statement syntax:

  {
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ...
    statement_n
  }
