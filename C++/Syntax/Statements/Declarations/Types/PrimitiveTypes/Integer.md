The language guarantees that an int will be at least as large as short, a
long at least as large as an int, and long long at least as large as long. The
type long long was introduced by the new standard.


The names of certain integer types can be abbreviated
  int can be removed in the case of a short, long, or long long
  signed can be removed as all integer types are signed by default

I.e., signed short int can be abbreviated as signed short, short int, or simply short; they all identify the same fundamental type.
