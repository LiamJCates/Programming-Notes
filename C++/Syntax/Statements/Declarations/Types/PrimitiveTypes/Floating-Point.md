A floating point literal is a numeric value directly represented in source code that is colloquially defined as a number that can be written with a fractional component.


The floating-point types represent single-, double-, and extended-precision val-
ues. The standard specifies a minimum number of significant digits. Most compil-
ers provide more precision than the specified minimum. Typically, floats are rep-
resented in one word (32 bits), doubles in two words (64 bits), and long doubles
in either three or four words (96 or 128 bits). The float and double types typi-
cally yield about 7 and 16 significant digits, respectively. The type long double

is often used as a way to accommodate special-purpose floating-point hardware;
its precision is more likely to vary from one implementation to another.
