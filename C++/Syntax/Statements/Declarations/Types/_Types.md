Types are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming.

In C++, a type defines both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on that data.

The data our programs manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type.

When the type of a variable named v is T, we often say that “v has type T” or, interchangeably, that “v is a T.”
