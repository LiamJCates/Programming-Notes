# Methods

Methods are a classes' member functions.

Methods create an explicit connection among a class, its data members, and some code. Defining a method is as simple as adding a function to a class definition.

For such a member function, the name of its class is also part of the function type. For example:

  char& String::operator[](int index); // type: char& String::(int)


Method Types:
  Class Methods
  Instance Methods
  Constructors
  Destructors

By default, all the methods are instance methods.
