## Computer Memory

Variables have been explained as locations in the computer's memory which can be accessed by a programmer provided identifier. This way, the program does not need to care about the physical address of the data in memory; it simply uses the identifier whenever it needs to refer to the data at that location.

For a C++ program, a block of computer memory is presented as consecutive memory cells, each one byte in size, and each with a unique address. These single-byte memory cells are ordered in a way that allows data representations larger than one byte to occupy memory cells that have consecutive addresses.

This way, each cell can be easily located in the memory by means of its unique address. For example, the memory cell with the address 1776 always follows immediately after the cell with address 1775 and precedes the one with 1777, and is exactly one thousand cells after 776 and exactly one thousand cells before 2776.

  +------+       +------+------+------+       +------+
  |      |  ...  |      |      |      |  ...  |      |
  +------+       +------+------+------+       +------+
    776            1775   1776   1777           2776

When a variable is declared, the memory needed to store its value is assigned a specific location in memory (its memory address). Generally, C++ programs do not actively decide the exact memory addresses where its variables are stored. Fortunately, that task is left to the environment where the program is run - generally, an operating system that decides the particular memory locations at runtime. The process of separating the programmer from the complexity of the underlying system is known as abstraction, abstraction allows the programmer and program to focus on details of greater importance.




Every position in memory has a number associated with it.

When your application starts, the computer sets aside a large chunk of memory and then works closely with the microprocessor to assign bits to the memory.

These bits are your applicationâ€™s variables and code.

As your application sits in memory, each function and each variable in your application has a place where it resides in memory. That place has a number associated with it, called an address. Therefore, your code, each function and each variable, has associated addresses.


To manipulate memory addresses C++ uses:
