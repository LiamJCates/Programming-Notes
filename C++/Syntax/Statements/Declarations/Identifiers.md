A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item.

Some identifiers are predefined by the language library; others are defined by the user.

C++ is case sensitive—uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. Thus, the identifier NUMBER is not the same as the identifier number. Similarly, the identifiers X and x are different.

All identifiers must obey C++’s rules for identifiers.

A C++ identifier:
  consists of letters, digits, and the underscore character (_)
  must begin with a letter or underscore.
  identifiers can be of any length.
  spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols cannot be part of an identifier.

identifiers that begin with an underline character (_) are - in most cases - considered reserved for compiler-specific keywords or external identifiers, as well as identifiers containing two successive underscore characters anywhere.
