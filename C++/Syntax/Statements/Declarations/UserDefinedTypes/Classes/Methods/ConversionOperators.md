Conversion Operators

Date holiday (12, 25, 2016); // instantiate
cout << holiday; // error in absence of conversion operator

The code would result in the following compile failure:

  error: binary '<<' : no operator found which takes a right-hand operand of type 'Date' (or there is no acceptable conversion).

This error essentially indicates that cout doesnâ€™t know how to interpret an instance of Date as class Date does not support the operators that convert its contents into a type that cout would accept. We know that cout can work well with a const char*:

std::cout << "Hello world"; // const char* works!

So, getting cout to work with an instance of type Date might be as simple as adding an operator that returns a const char* version:

operator const char*()
{
  // operator implementation that returns a char*
}

Note that such assignments cause implicit conversions, that is, the compiler has used the available conversion operator (in this case const char*) thereby permitting unintended assignments that get compiled without error. To avoid implicit conversions, use keyword explicit at the beginning of an operator declaration, as follows:

  explicit operator const char*()
  {
  // conversion code here
  }

Using explicit would force the programmer to assert his intention to convert using a cast:

  string strHoliday(static_cast<const char*>(Holiday));
  strHoliday=static_cast<const char*>(Date(11,11,2016));

Program as many operators as you think your class would be used with. If your application needs an integer representation of a Date, then you may program it as follows:

  explicit operator int()
  {
  return day + month + year;
  }

This would allow an instance of Date to be used or transacted as an integer:

  FuncTakesInt(static_cast<int>(Date(12, 25, 2016)));
