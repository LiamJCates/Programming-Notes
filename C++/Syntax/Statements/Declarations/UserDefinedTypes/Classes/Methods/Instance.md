Instance Methods (Non-Static):

Instance methods are often called non-static functions as they lack the static modifier used by class methods.

Instance methods can only be invoked over an instance of the class.




Some points regarding Instance methods:
  Instance methods can access other instance methods and instance variables directly.
  Instance methods can access class methods and variables directly.
  To access instance variable and methods they need to create an instance (object) of class.
  The special keyword “this” is valid only inside instance methods (and invalid inside class methods) as “this“ refers to the current instance.
