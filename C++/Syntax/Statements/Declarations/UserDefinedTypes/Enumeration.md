# Enumerations

There are situations where a particular variable should be allowed to accept only a certain set of values. These are situations where you donâ€™t want the colors in the rainbow to contain Turquoise or the directions on a compass to contain Left.

In both these cases, you need a type of variable whose values are restricted to a certain set defined by you. Enumerations are exactly the tool you need in this situation.

Enumerated types are types that are defined with a set of constant identifiers, known as enumerators, as possible values. Objects of these enumerated types can take any of these enumerators as value:

  enum type_name {
    value1,
    value2,
    value3,
    .
    .
  } object_names;

We declare enumerations using the keyword enum followed by the type name and a listing of the values it can take. The values that you specify for the data type must be identifiers. These values are arbitrary alphanumeric strings that will represent whatever categories you want to represent. Under the hood, these values are simply integers, but they allow you to write safer, more expressive code by using programmer-defined types rather than integers that could mean anything.

value1, value2, . . . are identifiers called enumerators. By listing all of the values between the braces, you also specify an ordering between the values. That is, value1 < value2 < value3 <.... Thus, the enumeration type is an ordered set of values. Moreover, the default value assigned to these enumerators starts at 0. That is, the default value assigned to value1 is 0, the default value assigned to value2 is 1, and so on. Also notice that the enumerators value1, value2, . . . are not variables.

For example, a new type of variable called colors_t could be defined to store colors with the following declaration:

  enum colors_t {black, blue, green, cyan, red, purple, yellow, white};

Notice that this declaration includes no other type, neither fundamental nor compound, in its definition. To say it another way, this creates a whole new data type from scratch without basing it on any other existing type. The possible values that variables of this new type color_t may take are the enumerators listed within braces. For example, once the colors_t enumerated type is declared, the following expressions will be valid:

colors_t mycolor;

mycolor = blue;
if (mycolor == green) mycolor = red;


A specific integer value can be specified for any of the possible values in the enumerated type. And if the constant value that follows it is itself not given its own value, it is automatically assumed to be the same value plus one. For example:

  enum months_t { january=1, february, march, april,
                  may, june, july, august,
                  september, october, november, december} y2k;

In this case, the variable y2k of the enumerated type months_t can contain any of the 12 possible values that go from january to december and that are equivalent to the values between 1 and 12 (not between 0 and 11, since january has been made equal to 1).

Declaring Variables
Once a data type is defined, you can declare variables of that type. The syntax for declaring variables of an enum type is the same as before:

  enum sports {BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL, HOCKEY, BASEBALL, SOCCER, VOLLEYBALL};
  sports popularSport, mySport;



### Assignment
Once a variable is declared, you can store values in it. Assuming the previous
declaration, the statement:

popularSport = FOOTBALL;

stores FOOTBALL in popularSport. The statement:

mySport = popularSport;

copies the value of popularSport into mySport.



### Operations on Enumeration Types
No arithmetic operations are allowed on the enumeration type.

Suppose you want to increment the value of popularSport by 1. You use the cast
operator as follows:

popularSport = static_cast<sports>(popularSport + 1);

When the type name is used, the compiler assumes that the user understands what
he or she is doing. Thus, the preceding statement is compiled, and during execution, it advances the value of popularSport to the next value in the list.

Consider the following statements:

  popularSport = FOOTBALL;
  popularSport = static_cast<sports>(popularSport + 1);

After the second statement, the value of popularSport is HOCKEY.

Similarly, the statements:

  popularSport = FOOTBALL;
  popularSport = static_cast<sports>(popularSport - 1);

result in storing BASKETBALL in popularSport.



Relational Operators
Because an enumeration is an ordered set of values, the relational operators can be used with the enumeration type. Once again, suppose you have the enumeration type sports and the variables popularSport and mySport as defined earlier. Then:

  FOOTBALL <= SOCCER    //true
  HOCKEY > BASKETBALL   //true
  BASEBALL < FOOTBALL   //false

Suppose that:

  popularSport = SOCCER;
  mySport = VOLLEYBALL;

Then:

popularSport < mySport  //true



### ENUMERATION TYPES AND LOOPS
Recall that the enumeration type is an integral type and that, using the cast operator (that is, type name), you can increment, decrement, and compare the values of the enumeration type. Therefore, you can use these enumeration types in loops.

Suppose mySport is a variable as declared earlier. Consider the loop:

  for (mySport = BASKETBALL; mySport <= SOCCER; mySport = static_cast<sports>(mySport + 1))
    //...

This for loop has five iterations.

Using enumeration types in loops increases the readability of the program.



### Declaring Variables When Defining the Enumeration Type

C++ allows you to combine these two steps into one. That is, you can declare variables of an enumeration type when you define an enumeration type:

  enum grades {A, B, C, D, F} courseGrade;

defines an enumeration type, grades, and declares a variable courseGrade of type
grades.

Anonymous Data Types
A data type wherein you directly specify values in the variable declaration with no type name is called an anonymous type:

  enum {BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, HOCKEY} mySport;

This statement specifies the values and declares a variable mySport, but no name is given to the data type.

Creating an anonymous type, however, has drawbacks.
First, because there is no name for the type, you cannot pass an anonymous type as a parameter to a function, and a function cannot return an anonymous type value.

Second, values used in one anonymous type can be used in another anonymous type, but variables of those types are treated differently:

  enum {ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH, GERMAN, RUSSIAN} languages;
  enum {ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH, GERMAN, RUSSIAN} foreignLanguages;

Even though the variables languages and foreignLanguages have the same values, the compiler treats them as variables of different types. The following statement is, therefore, illegal:

languages = foreignLanguages; //Illegal

Even though these facilities are available, use them with care. To avoid confusion, first define an enumeration type and then declare the variables.
