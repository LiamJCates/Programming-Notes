A computer program is a sequence of computer instructions specified in a programming language

The C++ Language specifies actions to be carried out via syntactic elements called statements.

Statements are by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program. This is because they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language. When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in sentences (not in random words or syllables). In C++, when we want to have our program do something, we typically write statements.

Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, itâ€™s probably a statement.

In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language instructions.

The next statement can start immediately after the semicolon, but for convenience and readability you often program successive statements on successive lines.
