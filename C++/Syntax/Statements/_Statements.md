Each C++ program is comprised of a sequence of statements, which are programming constructs that specify program execution.

All statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;)

The next statement can start immediately after the semicolon, but for convenience and readability you often program successive statements on successive lines.

If you need to spread a statement over two lines by inserting a backslash (\) at the end:
cout << "Hello \
World" << endl; // split to two lines is OK
