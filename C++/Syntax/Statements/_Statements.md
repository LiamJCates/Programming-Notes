Each C++ program is comprised of a sequence of statements, which are programming constructs that specify program execution.

Statements are fragments of the C++ program that are executed in sequence.

The next statement can start immediately after the semicolon, but for convenience and readability you often program successive statements on successive lines.

If you need to spread a statement over two lines by inserting a backslash (\) at the end:

  cout << "Hello \
  World" << endl; // split to two lines is OK



Statement Types:
  Compound Statements
  Expressions
  Declarations
  Control Structures
  Comments
  Assertions
