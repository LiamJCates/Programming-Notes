## Comments
There are two common types of comments in a C++ program:
  single-line comments
  multiple-line comments

Single-line comments begin with // and can be placed anywhere in the line:

  //single line

The compiler ignores anything that appears after // on the same line.

Multiple-line comments are enclosed between /* and */:

  /*
  Multiple
  Line
  Comment
  */

The compiler ignores anything that appears between /* and */
