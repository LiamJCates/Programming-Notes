Reference conversions

A reference to a class can be converted to a reference to a base class in these cases:

    The specified base class is accessible.

    The conversion is unambiguous. (For more information about ambiguous base-class references, see Multiple base classes.)

The result of the conversion is a pointer to the subobject that represents the base class.
