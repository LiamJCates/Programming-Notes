A simple program executes statements in the order they appear, from the top to the bottom of the program, sequentially.

The specific sequence of statements that the CPU executes is called the programâ€™s execution path (or path, for short).

Straight-line programs take the same path (execute the same statements in the same order) every time they are run.

Control structures provide alternatives to sequential program execution and are used to alter the sequential flow of execution.

Control Structures
  Selection
  Iteration
  Jump
  Halt
  Exception Handling


Selection statements cause the program to execute particular statements depending on some condition(s) and include if and switch

When a control flow statement causes point of execution to change to a non-sequential statement, this is called branching.

Iteration statements cause the program to repeat particular statements based on some condition(s) and include for, while, and do while loops.

Jump statements cause the program to transfer execution unconditionally and include break, continue and goto label statements.

Halts are flow control statements that terminate the program. In C++, halts are implemented as functions (rather than keywords).


Exception handling provides a way of transferring control and information from some point in the execution of a program to a handler associated with a point previously passed by the execution (in other words, exception handling transfers control up the call stack)
