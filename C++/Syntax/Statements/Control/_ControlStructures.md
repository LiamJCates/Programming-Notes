A simple program executes statements in the order they appear, from the top to the bottom of the program, sequentially.

Control structures provide alternatives to sequential program execution and are used to alter the sequential flow of execution.

Control Structures
  Selection
  Iteration
  Jump
  Exception Handling


Selection statements cause the program to execute particular statements depending on some condition(s) and include if and switch

Iteration statements cause the program to repeat particular statements based on some condition(s) and include for, while, and do while loops.

Jump statements cause the program to transfer execution unconditionally and include break, continue and goto label statements.

Exception handling provides a way of transferring control and information from some point in the execution of a program to a handler associated with a point previously passed by the execution (in other words, exception handling transfers control up the call stack)
