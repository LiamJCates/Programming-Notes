Control structures provide alternatives to sequential program execution and are used to alter the sequential flow of execution.

Control Structures
  Selection
  Iteration
  Jump
  Error Handling



Selection statements cause the program to execute particular statements depending on some condition(s) and include if and switch

Iteration statements cause the program to repeat particular statements based on some condition(s) and include for, while, and do while loops.


Jump statements cause the program to transfer execution unconditionally and include break, continue and goto label statements.
