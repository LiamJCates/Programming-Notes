### std::abort

The std::abort() function causes your program to terminate abnormally.

Abnormal termination means the program had some kind of unusual runtime error and the program couldnâ€™t continue to run. For example, trying to divide by 0 will result in an abnormal termination.

std::abort() does not do any cleanup.

  #include <cstdlib>
  #include <iostream>

  int main()
  {
      std::cout << 1 << '\n';
      std::abort();

      // The following statements never execute
      std::cout << 2 << '\n';

      return 0;
  }

We will see cases where std::abort is called implicitly including the assert statement.
