## Iteration Statements
Iteration statements repeatedly execute some code.

C++ uses four kinds of iteration statements are the while loop, the do-while loop, the for loop, and the range-based for loop


while loop

  attr* while ( condition )
    statement

do-while loop

  attr* do
    statement
  while ( expression ) ;

for loop

  attr\* for ( init-statement\* ; condition\* ; expression* )
    statement

range for loop (since C++11)

  attr* for ( for-range-decl : for-range-init )
    statement


Above * specifies an optional component
