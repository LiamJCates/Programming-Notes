## Bitwise operators
Bitwise operators modify variables considering the bit patterns that represent the values they store.

| operator | asm equivalent | description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| & | AND | Bitwise AND |
| \| | OR | Bitwise inclusive OR |
| ^ | XOR | Bitwise exclusive OR |
| ~ | NOT | Unary complement (bit inversion) |
| << | SHL | Shift bits left |
| >> | SHR | Shift bits right |

bitwise logical operators work on integral types and perform a
Boolean operation at the bit level and returns an integral type matching
its operands.
