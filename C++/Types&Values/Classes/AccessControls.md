Access modifiers in C++ class defines the access control rules.
Access controls restrict class-member access.

C++ has 3 access modifier keywords:
  public
  private
  protected

These access modifiers are used to set boundaries for availability of members of a class.
Access modifiers are followed by a colon.
They change the boundary for all the declarations that follow them.

Public class members are available to all class clients.

Private class members are not available to any code outside of the class. Invalid access will result in a compile time error

Protected class members are available inside the class and to any derived class.
