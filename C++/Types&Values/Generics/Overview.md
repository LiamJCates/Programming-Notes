In Java and in C# generics are resolved at runtime, which means every time your application runs some cycles are spent figuring out what types to use, or what methods to call, and so on, but templates in C++ are resolved at compile time, which means that once you've successfully compiled and deployed your code you're never going to pay for that genericity, for that ability to write code once that works across a variety of types. And these sorts of advantages show up throughout C++, and that's why it's the language if what you care about is speed of execution.
