Queue is a variation of the List ADT that follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy.

Queue has the following application uses:
1. Access to shared resources (e.g., printer)
2. Multiprogramming
3. Message queue

Queue ADT Operations:

Add(): Add a new element to the back of the queue.

Remove(): remove an element from the front of the queue and return its value.

Front(): return the value of the element at the front of the queue.

Size(): returns the number of elements inside the queue.

IsEmpty(): returns 1 if the queue is empty otherwise return 0

Note:- All the above Queue operations are implemented in O(1)  Time Complexity.
