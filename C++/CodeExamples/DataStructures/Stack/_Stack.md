Stack is a variation of the List ADT that follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) strategy.

The various applications of stack are:
1. Recursion: recursive calls are preformed using system stack.
2. Postfix evaluation of expression.
3. Backtracking
4. Depth-first search of trees and graphs.
5. Converting a decimal number into a binary number etc.

Stack ADT Operations

Push(k): Adds a new item to the top of the stack

Pop(): Remove an element from the top of the stack and return its value.

Peak(): Returns the value of the element at the top of the stack

Size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack

isEmpty(): determines whether the stack is empty. It returns 1 if the stack is empty or return 0.

isFull(): determines whether the stack is full. It returns 1 if the stack is empty or return 0.

Note: All the above Stack operations are implemented in O(1) Time Complexity.
