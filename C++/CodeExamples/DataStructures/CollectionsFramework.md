C++ Collection Framework, which is a
set of high quality, high performance & reusable data-structures and algorithms.

The following advantages of using a C++ collection framework:
1. Programmers do not have to implement basic data structures and algorithms repeatedly. reinvention the wheel. Thus, the programmer can devote more effort in business logic.
2. The C++ Collection Framework code is well-tested, high quality, high performance code there by increasing the quality of the programs.
3. Development cost is reduced as basic data structures and algorithms are implemented in Collections framework.
4. Easy for the review and understanding others programs as other developers also use the Collection framework. In addition, collection framework is well documented.
