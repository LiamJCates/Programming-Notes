<limits>
int min{std::numeric_limits<int>::max()};
int max{std::numeric_limits<int>::min()};


 The name std::numeric_limits is part of the C++ standard library and lets you query the attributes
 of the built-in arithmetic types. You can determine the number of bits a type requires, the number of
 decimal digits, the minimum and maximum values, and more. Put the type that you are curious about in
 angle brackets. (Youâ€™ll see this approach to using types quite often in C++.) Thus, you could also query
 std::numeric_limits<bool>::min() and get false as the result.
