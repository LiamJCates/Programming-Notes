a map is known as an associative array or a dictionary. It is implemented as a balanced binary tree.
The standard-library map is a container of pairs of values optimized for lookup. We can use the
same initializer as for vector and list


When indexed by a value of its first type (called the key), a map returns the corresponding value of
the second type (called the value or the mapped type).

If a key isnâ€™t found, it is entered into the map with a default value for its value.

To avoid this use find() and insert() instead of [ ]


Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.

In a map, the key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key. The types of key and mapped value may differ, and are grouped together in member type value_type, which is a pair type combining both:


typedef pair<const Key, T> value_type;

Internally, the elements in a map are always sorted by its key following a specific strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison object (of type Compare).

map containers are generally slower than unordered_map containers to access individual elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order.

The mapped values in a map can be accessed directly by their corresponding key using the bracket operator ((operator[]).

Maps are typically implemented as binary search trees.
