The main objective of a program is to manipulate data and generate results. Achieving this goal requires the ability to store data into computer memory, access a particular piece of data, and manipulate the data through various algorithms.

ANSI/ISO Standard C++ is equipped with a portion of the stdlib called the Standard Template Library (STL).

The C++ Standard Library is a library file, a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” as part of C++, for reuse in other programs. It contains common functionality for reuse in programs.

The STL provides a C++ Collection Framework, which is a set of reliable, reusable, high performance data-structures called containers, the algorithms to manipulate them, and iterators that serve as the interface between the two.


The following advantages of using a C++ collection framework:

1. Programmers do not have to implement basic data structures and algorithms repeatedly, they can use prepackaged generic implementations easily accommodated to the problem at hand. Thereby it prevents the reinvention the wheel.

2. The C++ Collection Framework code is well-tested, high quality, high
performance code there by increasing the quality of the programs.

3. Development cost is reduced as basic data structures and algorithms are
implemented in Collections framework. The STL relieves programmers from writing their own implementations of various classes and functions. Thus, the programmer can devote more effort in business logic.

4. Easy for the review and understanding programs as other developers also use the Collection framework resulting in a similar approach. In addition, collection framework is well documented.
