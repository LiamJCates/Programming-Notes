ANSI/ISO Standard C++ is equipped with a Standard Template Library (STL).

The standard template library (STL) is the portion of the stdlib that provides containers and the algorithms to manipulate them, with iterators serving as the interface between the two.

The STL relieves programmers from writing their own implementations of various classes and functions. Instead, they can use prepackaged generic implementations accommodated to the problem at hand.

The library includes three types of generic entities: containers, iterators, and algorithms.

Algorithms are frequently used functions that can be applied to different data structures.

The application is mediated through the iterators that determine which algorithms can be applied to which types of objects.



Components of the STL
The main objective of a program is to manipulate data and generate results. Achieving this goal requires the ability to store data into computer memory, access a particular piece of data, and write algorithms to manipulate the data.

The STL is equipped with these features to effectively manipulate data. More formally, the STL has three main components:
? Containers
? Iterators
? Algorithms

Containers and iterators are class templates.
Iterators are used to step through the elements of a container.
Algorithms are used to manipulate data.
