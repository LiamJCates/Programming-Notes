values (that is, strings) of type string are not null terminated. Variables of type string can also be used to read and store the names of input/output files. However, the argument to the function open must be a null-terminated string â€” that is, a C-string. Therefore, if we use a variable of type string to read the name of an input/output file and then use this variable to open a file, the value of the variable must (first) be converted to a C-string  using c_str:

strVar.c_str()


The following statements illustrate how to use variables of type string to read the names of the input/output files during program execution and open those files:
ifstream infile;
string fileName;
cout << "Enter the input file name: ";
cin >> fileName;
infile.open(fileName.c_str()); //open the input file

Of course, you must also include the header file string in the program. The output file has similar conventions.
