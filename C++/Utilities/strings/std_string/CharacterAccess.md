Character access

There are two almost identical ways to access characters in a string. The easier to use and faster version is the overloaded operator[]:

char& string::operator[] (size_type nIndex)
const char& string::operator[] (size_type nIndex) const

Both of these functions return the character with index nIndex
0 <= nIndex < length

Passing an invalid index results in undefined behavior

Using length() as the index is valid for const strings only, and returns the value generated by the stringâ€™s default constructor. It is not recommended that you do this.

Because char& is the return type, you can use this to edit characters in the array

  std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" };
  std::cout << sSource[5] << '\n';
  sSource[5] = 'X';
  std::cout << sSource << '\n';

Output:

f
abcdeXg

There is also a non-operator version:

char& string::at (size_type nIndex)
const char& string::at (size_type nIndex) const

Both of these functions return the character with index nIndex

This version is slower since it uses exceptions to check if the nIndex is valid. If you are not sure whether nIndex is valid, you should use this version to access the array.

Passing an invalid index results in an out_of_range exception

Because char& is the return type, you can use this to edit characters in the array 

  std::string sSource{ "abcdefg" };
  std::cout << sSource.at(5) << '\n';
  sSource.at(5) = 'X';
  std::cout << sSource << '\n';

Output:

f
abcdeXg
