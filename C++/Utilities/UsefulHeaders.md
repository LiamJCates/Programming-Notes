The Header files are briefed along with their description below.

| Headers |	Description |
|---------|-------------|
| iostream | This header contains the prototype for standard input and output functions used in C++ like cin, cout, etc. |
| cmath | This is the header containing various math library functions. |
| iomanip | This header contains stream manipulator functions that allow us to format the stream of data. |
| cstdlib | The header cstdlib contains various functions related to conversion between text and numbers, memory allocation, random numbers, and other utility functions. |
| ctime | ctime contains function prototypes related to date and time manipulations in C++. |
| cctype | This header includes function prototypes that test the type of characters (digit, punctuation, etc.). It also has prototypes that are used to convert from uppercase to lowercase and another way around. |
| cstring | cstring header includes function prototypes for C-style string-processing functions. |
| cstdio | This header contains function prototypes for the C-style standard input/output library functions which we included initially in stdio.h |
| fstream | Function prototypes for functions that perform input/output from/to files on disk are included in fstream header. |
| climits | climits header has the integral size limits of the system. |
| cassert | cassert header contains macros and variables for adding diagnostics that help us in program debugging. |
| cfloat | This header file contains the size limits for floating-point numbers on the system. |
| string | The header string defines the class string of the C++ Standard Library. |
| list, vector, stack, queue, deque, map,  set, bitset | All these headers are used for Standard Template Library (STL) implementation. Each of these headers contains the respective class definition and function prototypes. |
| typeinfo | This header contains various classes for Runtime Type Identification (RTTI). |
| exception,  stdexcept | All the classes and functions used for exception handling in C++ are included in these two headers. |
| memory | This header is used by the C++ standard library to allocate memory. |
| sstream | Functions that read input from strings in memory and output to strings in memory require functions prototypes from sstream header to implement the functionality. |
| functional | Used by C++ standard library algorithms. |
| iterator | Function prototypes and classes in this header are used by Standard Template Library to traverse through or iterate through the data inside containers. |
| algorithm | Methods that act on STL container data are included in this header algorithm |
| locale | To process data in the original natural form for different languages or locales (currencies, character presentation, etc.), the locale header definitions are used. |
| limits | This header defines the data type limit for Numbers on each platform. |
| utility | This header contains utility functions and classes used by the Standard C++ library. |
