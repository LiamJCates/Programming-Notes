Compound Types
C++ supports a wide variety of types based on the fundamental types; these other types are known as compound data types.

In a compound data type, each data item is a collection of other data items. Fundamental data types are building blocks of compound data types.

Compound types are arrays, functions, object pointers, function pointers, member object pointers, member function pointers, references, classes, unions, enumerations, and their cv-qualified variants.
