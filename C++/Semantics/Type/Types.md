## Type System

The objective of a C++ program is to manipulate binary data entities to achieve a desired result.

The underlying binary representation of various data entities is given a name semantic meaning according to the C++ type system.

C++ is a strongly typed object-oriented language meaning that all data entities manipulated are of a predefined object type.

The operations that manipulate data objects and the domain of legal states that a data object of a given type can assume are determined by it's data type.

By being so type conscious, C++ has built-in checks to guard against errors.



Each C++ data entity, an object, reference, function, or expression, is associated with a type. C++ data types generally fall into the following three categories:
  Fundamental data type
  Compound data type
  User-Defined




Note

Many of the types defined in newer versions of C++ (e.g. std::nullptr_t) use a _t suffix. This suffix means “type”, and it’s a common nomenclature applied to many modern types.
