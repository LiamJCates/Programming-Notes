Types are grouped in various categories based on their properties:

    object types are (possibly cv-qualified) types that are not function types, reference types, or the type void
    scalar types are (possibly cv-qualified) object types that are not array types or class types
    trivial types (see also std::is_trivial), POD types (see also std::is_pod), literal types (see also std::is_literal_type), and other categories listed in the the type traits library or as named type requirements.
