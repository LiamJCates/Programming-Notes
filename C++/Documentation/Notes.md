Good programming requires extensive comments and documentation.  

At least:

explain the purpose of each instance variable, and for each method explain its purpose, parameters, returns, where applicable.

You should also strive for a consistent layout and for expressive variable names.  

For a class, one might list the functions, constructors and public fields, and for each method explains what it does together with pre-conditions, post-conditions, the meaning of the parameters, exceptions that may be thrown and other things.
