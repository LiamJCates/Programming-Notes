Qt is a mature and powerful framework for delivering sophisticated applications across a
multitude of platforms. It is widely used in embedded devices including TVs, satellite settop boxes, medical equipment, car dashboards, and much more. It also has a rich history in
the Linux world, with KDE and Sailfish OS using it extensively and many apps in the stores
being developed using Qt. It has also made great strides in the Mobile arena over the past
several years. However, in the Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X worlds, the
dominance of C#/.NET and Objective-C/Cocoa mean that Qt is often overlooked.
