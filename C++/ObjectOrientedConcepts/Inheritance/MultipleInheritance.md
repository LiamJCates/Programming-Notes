Multiple Inheritance

A C++ class can be derived from more than one classes, which means it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes.

C++ multiple inheritance class uses derivation list syntax:

  class derived-class: access-specifier baseA, access-specifier baseB, ...

where derived-class, the name of the derived class is followed by a : and a comma separated derivation list which consists of an access-specifier and base class name for each base class relationship
