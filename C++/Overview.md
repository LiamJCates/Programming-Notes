C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs.
Initially C++ was designed to be an object-oriented successor to C. Due to this, C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.


Why Learn C++
    C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.

    C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.

    C++ is very popular

    C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.

    C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.



C++ Characteristics
C++ is a mid-level, statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.


middle-level
C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

statically typed
The type of every C++ entity (e.g., object, value, name, and expression) must be known to the compiler at its point of use. The type of an object determines the set of operations applicable to it.

compiled
After writing the source code for a C++ program, the next step is to turn
your source code into an executable program. The compiler tool chain (or
tool chain) converts source code into a program.

general-purpose
C++ is a programming language dedicated to a general-purpose, designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.

case-sensitive
case sensitivity defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct (case-sensitive) or equivalent (case-insensitive).

free-form
A free-form language is a programming language in which the positioning of characters on the page in program text is insignificant and whitespace characters are used only to delimit tokens, and have no other significance.

procedural
derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures or subroutines, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution.

object-oriented
Initially C++ was designed to be an object-oriented successor to C that implements concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Generic
Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters.








Syntax and semantics
While there is no single organization the controls all of C++, individual vendors and communities implement the ISO standard which determines the syntax and semantics of the C++ language

The ISO committee updates the standard every three years

It is suggested that projects always used the most recent implementation of the standard.

The ISO C++ standard defines two kinds of entities:
  • Core language features, such as built-in types (e.g., char and int) and loops (e.g., for-statements and while-statements)
  • Standard-library components, such as containers (e.g., vector and map) and I/O operations (e.g., << and getline())

The standard-library components are perfectly ordinary C++ code provided by every C++ implementation. That is, the C++ standard library can be implemented in C++ itself and is (with very minor uses of machine code for things such as thread context switching). This implies that C++ is sufficiently expressive and efficient for the most demanding systems programming tasks.






The following list shows some application types:

✦ GTK+ Project: This is a graphical application that includes, well, a window.
You know the kind: It usually has a menu across the top and something
inside it that you can either click or type into. It relies on the Gimp Toolkit
(GTK), which provides an incredibly flexible interface that runs on a
number of platforms including Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.

✦ Console Application: This is an application that gets a paltry Console
window instead of a graphical window. Console refers to a window with
a command prompt. (Folks who recall the old days, before Windows, call
it a DOS box, and you may know it as a terminal window when working
with operating systems such as the Mac or Linux.)

✦ Static library: A static library is a set of C++ code that you use later in
another project. It’s like making a really great marinade that you won’t
use up today. You’ll use some of it tomorrow and some of it after that.
Same with a C++ library.

✦ Dynamic Link Library: A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) is kind of like a
static library except it is separated from the main application and gets
its own file with a .DLL extension.
