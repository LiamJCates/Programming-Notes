Client refers to any entity that requests a service from another entity. The client does not bother about how the entity providing the service actually provides the service - the client is happy as long as the service is available and fulfills its use case. Hence, when a method M1 within a class calls another method M2 then M1 is a client of M2. Similarly when a class C1 requests service of C2 then C1 is a client of C2.
