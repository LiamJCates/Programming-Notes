Deployment diagrams provide a visual representation of a system's hardware and
software. Physical hardware components are illustrated, along with the particular software
components that are on them. The hardware components are represented as nodes, and
software is represented as an execution environment.
The nodes are drawn as three-dimensional rectangles and represent hardware for a
software object, such as a database. As illustrated in the following example, associations are
annotated with lines marked with the type of communication protocol used. Our example
shows TCP/IP as the communication type:
