In general an abstract class is used to define an implementation and is intended to be inherited from by concrete classes.

Concrete types are defined by their representation being part of their definition. In that, they resemble built-in types.

In contrast, an abstract type is a type that completely insulates a user from implementation details.

Defining an abstract class is a way of forcing a contract between the class designer and the users of that class.
