Abstraction is commonly defined as the extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify the conceptualization and implementation of a system.

In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is:

  the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in systems to focus attention on details of greater importance; it is similar in nature to the process of generalization;
  the creation of abstract concept-objects by mirroring common features or attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study â€“ the result of the process of abstraction.

Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.

In object-oriented programming theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system.

When abstraction is used to:
  define a relation between the state and behavior of an object by placing their implementation into a shared unit of abstraction it is called encapsulation

  present a contract for a set of behaviors that can be satisfied by a variety of objects without concern for how any individual implementation fulfills the contract it is called an interface

  protect and ensure the reliability of a data type by controlling access to aspects of its implementation it is called data hiding.

  enable objects of different types to be substituted, it is called polymorphism.

  simplify a complex set of relationships between classes, it is called delegation or inheritance.
