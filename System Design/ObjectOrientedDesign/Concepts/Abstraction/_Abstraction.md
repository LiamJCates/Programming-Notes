Abstraction is commonly defined as the extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify the conceptualization and implementation of a system.

Abstraction hides complexity by providing an abstract picture of a system that shows only useful data by providing the most necessary details.

Abstraction helps system designers partition the program into many independent portions and the interactions between them.

Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.

In object-oriented programming theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system.

Abstraction of functionality into an "actor" is generally achieved through encapsulating the details of an object's specification, then presenting an interface that is composed of essential information to client code while using data hiding to obfuscate specific implementation details.

When abstraction is used to:
  define a relation between the state and behavior of an object by placing their implementation into a shared unit of abstraction it is called encapsulation

  present a contract for a set of behaviors that can be satisfied by a variety of objects without concern for how any individual implementation fulfills the contract it is called an interface

  protect and ensure the reliability of a data type by controlling access to aspects of its implementation it is called data hiding.

  enable objects of different types to be substituted, it is called polymorphism.

  simplify a complex set of relationships between classes, it is called delegation or inheritance.

  provide a general method to handle objects of unique types, it is called generics
