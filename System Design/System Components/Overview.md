Elements of a Computer System
A computer is an electronic device capable of performing commands. The basic commands that a computer performs are input (get data), output (display result), storage, and performance of arithmetic and logical operations. There are two main components of a computer system: hardware and software.

Hardware
Major hardware components include the central processing unit (CPU); main memory (MM), also called random access memory (RAM); input/output devices; and secondary storage. Some examples of input devices are the keyboard, mouse, and secondary storage. Examples of output devices are the screen, printer, and secondary storage.

Central Processing Unit and Main Memory
The central processing unit is the “brain” of a computer and the most expensive piece of hardware in a computer. The more powerful the CPU, the faster the computer. Arithmetic and logical operations are carried out inside the CPU.

Main Memory
Main memory, or random access memory, is connected directly to the CPU. All programs must be loaded into main memory before they can be executed. Similarly, all data must be brought into main memory before a program can manipulate it.

When the computer is turned off, everything in main memory is lost.
Main memory is an ordered sequence of cells, called memory cells. Each cell has a unique location in main memory, called the address of the cell. These addresses help you access the information stored in the cell.  Today’s computers come with main memory consisting of millions to billions of cells.

The content of a cell can be either a programming instruction or data. Moreover, this figure shows the data as numbers and letters. However, as explained later in this chapter, main memory stores everything as sequences of 0s and 1s. The memory addresses are also expressed as sequences of 0s and 1s.

SECONDARY STORAGE
Because programs and data must be loaded into the main memory before processing and because everything in main memory is lost when the computer is turned off, information stored in the main memory must be saved in some other device for permanent storage. The device that stores information permanently (unless the device becomes unusable or you change the information by rewriting it) is called secondary
storage. To be able to transfer information from main memory to secondary storage, these components must be directly connected to each other. Examples of secondary
storage are hard disks, flash drives, and CD-ROMs.

Input /Output Devices
For a computer to perform a useful task, it must be able to take in data and programs and display the results of calculations. The devices that feed data and programs into computers are called input devices. The keyboard, mouse, scanner, camera, and secondary storage are examples of input devices. The devices that the computer uses to display results are called output devices. A monitor, printer, and secondary storage are examples of output devices.

Software
Software are programs written to perform specific tasks. For example, word processors are programs that you use to write letters, papers, and even books. All software is written in programming languages. There are two types of programs: system programs and application programs.

System programs control the computer. The system program that loads first when you turn on your computer is called the operating system. Without an operating system, the computer is useless. The operating system handles the overall activity of the computer and provides services. Some of these services include memory management, input/output activities, and storage management. The operating system has a special program that organizes secondary storage so that you can conveniently access information. Some well-known operating systems are Windows 10, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android.

Application programs perform a specific task. Word processors, spreadsheets, and games are examples of application programs. The operating system is the program that runs application programs
