What is an Operating System

An operating system is software that manages a system's hardware while insulating users from the complexity of the underlying system.

An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.

The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among various users  
programs while also preventing user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system.

The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute
programs in a convenient, efficient, and secure manner.
