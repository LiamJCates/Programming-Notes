1970s and 1980s -
Structured Analysis and Design was the common method used to design software, used mostly procedural languages.

late 1980s and 1990s
object oriented programming was becoming very popular.
found that structured analysis and design didn't work so well to design object oriented programs.
So a new class of modeling arose, Object Oriented Analysis and Design, OOA&D.
Unfortunately, there were a lot of different approaches to this. Several techniques gained large followings, there was no standard, no single way that all teams used to communicate.


1994     
Jim Rumbaugh joined Grady Booch at Rational Software, and merged their personal techniques for modeling, creating a prototype UML

1995    Rational Software bought Objectory, Ivar Jacobson's company and furthered proto-UML
This formed what is now known as the The 3 Amigos: James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch, and Ivar Jacobson.

1997
The object management group called for a submission of papers to define a standard object oriented analysis and design language.
Rational Software submitted what they called UML, Unified Modeling Language 1.0.

The object management group ended up standardizing UML.
After public revision suggestions they released what we know of as UML 1.1
start of a common OOA&D object oriented modeling language.


Today we have the latest version of UML 2.5.1 released in December 2017
