Key Considerations

Keeping these considerations in mind will make sure that your diagrams are much more useable both to you and those who will find them and consume your diagrams.

Keep our diagrams clean
    Readable. 
grouping related elements
reduce line crossings
     Uncluttered

Focused.
a multitude of diagrams are necessary to model complex systems
Keep in mind the purpose of each, focused
ensure that what is needed in the diagram, be careful to not put in extraneous things

Precise.
The more precise we are, the more correct we are in laying things out and saying what we mean in our diagrams and meaning what is said in those diagrams and making sure that everybody understands the diagrams will make the diagrams so much more usable.


Goals
Every diagram you create will have some level of these goals being important.
Visualize
a quick look at them should help to understand parts of our system
allow people to visualize what we're building
Specify
be clear about those things that we're specifying,
ensure that we're using the elements in the diagrams correctly.

Document
potentially what we're building, what we want others to build for us if we're an architect maybe, designing something, document what was built. The documents can support our support personnel as bugs come to light, they can look at the documents and maybe better understand where to look in the system to identify or to find the bug that has been identified.



The one main thing to keep in mind, is the audience.
If as you create UML diagrams, you're always thinking about who is going to be the user of this diagram that's being built and how they are going to understand it, this will help you make sure that you create very usable diagrams.
