Common Extensions

The UML is a very extensible language; when it was created, it was known that it would need to grow over time

Annotations/notes.
They look like a little notecard with the edge folded down and simply free form text to go ahead and type in there whatever you want. These can tie with a line to some element on our diagram.

Stereotypes
shown with a less than less than, a word, and a greater than greater than symbol.
Ex: <<Interface>>
In this case, this is an interface stereotype. It is identifying the element on the diagram as being an interface

Iconic Stereotype
A simple node is a named cube
Iconic Stereotypes present a visual representation
For instance, when we are talking about different nodes in the Deployment diagram, we may want to use something that shows more specifically that it's a database server or a web server and make it visually easier to identify what's in the document or in the diagram, rather than having to read it.
