Object-Oriented Paradigm

an approach to programming that breaks a programming problem into objects that interact with each other.

In the most general sense, a program can be organized in one of two ways:
around its code (what is happening)
around its data (what is being affected).

Structured programming techniques organize around code. “code acting on data.”
Traditional structured programming consists of designing a set of procedures (or algorithms) to solve a problem. Once the procedures are determined, the traditional next step was to find appropriate ways to store the data.

Software design using the object oriented paradigm focuses on objects and operations on objects. The object-oriented approach combines the power of the procedural paradigm with an added dimension that integrates data with operations into objects. In procedural programming, data and operations on the data are separate, and this methodology requires passing data to methods.

Object-oriented programming places data and the operations that pertain to them in an object. This approach solves many of the problems inherent in procedural programming. The object-oriented programming approach organizes programs in a way that mirrors the real world, in which all objects are associated with both attributes and activities. Using objects improves software reusability and makes programs easier to develop and easier to maintain. Programming in Java involves thinking in terms of objects; a Java program can be viewed as a collection of cooperating objects.

Object-oriented programs reverse the order: putting the data first, then looking at the algorithms to operate on the data. They are organized around data, with the key principle being “data controlling access to code.” In an object-oriented language, you define the data and the routines that are permitted to act on that data. Thus, a data type defines precisely what sort of operations can be applied to that data. To support the principles of object-oriented programming, all OOP languages, including Java, have three traits in common: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) involves programming using objects. An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified.

An object has a unique identity, state, and behavior.
■ The state of an object (also known as its properties or attributes) is represented by data fields with their current values.
■ The behavior of an object (also known as its actions) is defined by methods. To invoke a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action.

Objects of the same type are defined using a common class.
