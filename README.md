# Programming-Notes

Welcome,

These documents serve to address topics necessary for pursuing a professional career in software development.

Here you will find a collection of programs along with explanations and information that I hope will be as valuable to whom ever finds it as it is to me.

This is a work in progress featuring the conversion of years of personal notes redrafted and hosted to provide easy access for myself and anyone else to download.

Should you find anything that is indefinite, incorrect, or inconsistent do not hesitate to contact me!
