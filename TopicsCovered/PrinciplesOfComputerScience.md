A fundamental grasp of Computer Science require familiarity with all concepts on this list in addition to the language-specific list of the subject(s).



Program design
Read and understand a problem description, purpose, and goals
Choose appropriate data representation and algorithms.
Apply functional decomposition.
Extend a given class using inheritance.



Program Analysis
Testing
  Test classes and libraries in isolation.
Identify boundary cases and generate appropriate test data.
Perform integration testing.
Debugging
Categorize errors: compile-time, run-time, logic.
Identify and correct errors
Debugging, adding extra output statements, hand-tracing code.
Understand and modify existing code
Understand error handling
Understand runtime exceptions
Pre-and post-conditions
Assertions
Analysis of algorithms
Informal comparisons of running times
Exact calculation of statement execution counts
