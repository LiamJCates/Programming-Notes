Divide and Conquer
The divide and conquer technique decomposes complex problems into smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then solved and these partial solutions are recombined to determine the overall solution. This technique is often used for searching and sorting.


Recursive algorithms in general typically follow a divide-and-conquer approach

Divide and Conquer approach uses a recursive structure to solve a given problem by self reference, dividing the problem into smaller subproblems that are instances of the original problem until they are so small that they can be solved in a straightforward manner.

When the problems are large enough to solve recursively we call this the recursive case.

Recursive Case: when the problem instances are large and must be solved by recursively splitting.
Base Case: When the problem becomes small enough, we halt recursion and say that the recursion “bottoms out” and a simple solution can be found.

The divide-and-conquer approach involves two steps at each level of recursion which progress until a base case is reached.

Divide: the problem is divided into two or more sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem; typically these sub-problems are disjoint.

Conquer: the sub-problems are conquered by solving them recursively, and their solutions are combined into the solution of the original problem

When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem.



The divide-and-conquer paradigm involves three recursive steps
Divide Conquer Merge

Divide/Break
This step involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. Sub-problems should represent a part of the original problem. This step generally takes a recursive approach to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. At this stage, sub-problems become atomic in nature but still represent some part of the actual problem.

Conquer/Solve
This step receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. Generally, at this level, the problems are considered 'solved' on their own.

Merge/Combine
When the smaller sub-problems are solved, this stage recursively combines them until they formulate a solution of the original problem. This algorithmic approach works recursively and conquer & merge steps works so close that they appear as one.

Examples
The following computer algorithms are based on divide-and-conquer programming approach −
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Binary Search
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
Closest pair (points)
There are various ways available to solve any computer problem, but the mentioned are a good example of divide and conquer approach.
