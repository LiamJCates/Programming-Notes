Brute force is a simple, exhaustive technique that evaluates every possible outcome to find a solution.

A brute force algorithm is generally the least efficient but simplest method to code.

The direct exhaustive search algorithm has the merit of extreme simplicity; the less complex an algorithm is, the more likely it is to be programmed correctly. However, exhaustive search algorithms are usually not as efficient as possible.
