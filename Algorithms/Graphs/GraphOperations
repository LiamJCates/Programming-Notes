Graph Algorithms

Graph Searching
Searching a graph means systematically following the edges of the graph to visit its vertices

BFS and DFS

A breadth-fi rst search (BFS) algorithm visits the immediate children
of a node before it goes any deeper. A depth-fi rst search (DFS) goes
as deep as it can down a path before visiting sibling nodes (that is,
before visiting nodes that share the same parent).
A breadth-fi rst search typically uses a Queue (FIFO) to keep track of
nodes, whereas a depth-fi rst search typically uses a Stack (LIFO).
