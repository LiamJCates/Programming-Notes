Operations on a Chained Hash Table

1. Insertion in a Chained Hash Table – The process of inserting an element is quite simple. First, we get the hash value from the hash function,
which will map to the hash table. After mapping, the element is inserted
in the linked list. The running time complexity of inserting an element in
a chained hash table is O(1).

2. Deletion from a Chained Hash Table – The process of deleting an
element from the chained hash table is same as we used in the singly
linked list. First, we will perform a search operation, and then the delete
operation as in the case of the singly linked list is performed. The running time complexity of deleting an element from a chained hash table
is O(m), where m is the number of elements present in the linked list at
that location.

3. Searching in a Chained Hash Table – The process of searching for an
element in a chained hash table is also very simple. First, we will get the
hash value of the key by the hash function in the hash table. Then we will
search for the element in the linked list. The running time complexity of
searching for an element in a chained hash table is O(m), where m is the
number of elements present in the linked list at that location.
