For Loop

for(initialization; test condition; increment){
  //loop statements
}



While loop

while(test condition){
  //loop statements
}




the grammatical rules of C require that a for and while
statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, can satisfy that requirement. It can be put on a separate line to make it visible.
