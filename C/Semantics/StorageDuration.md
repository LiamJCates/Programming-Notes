Storage Duration of Objects

There are four storage durations. Static, thread, automatic and allocated. Here, we will not discuss thread which we will talk about later. A static variable which is local to a function of global variable has static duration and it lives in data segment in memory and has static storage duration. A variable local to a function or block which is not dynamically allocated on heap by using either of malloc, calloc or realloc has automatic storage and has function or block has automatic storage and is cleaned up automatically and it lives on stack. Allocated storage duration variables can persist as long as they want after allocation on heap by using one of malloc, calloc and realloc as long as the name is kept in scope and a corresponding free is not called on that name of the variable. Now let us discuss operators and expressions.

Whenever operators and expressions come in picture you may have a set of mixed data then to perform oration data is converted from one type to another. This has an entire section devoted to it in specification at §(iso.6.3)
. There are two types of conversions. Many operators convert their operands silently which is called “implicit conversion” and then we have cast operators which we can use to explicitly convert values from one type to another which is called “explicit conversion”. We will first see implicit conversion.
