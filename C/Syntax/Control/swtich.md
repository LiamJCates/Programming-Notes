Switch Statements

switch statement
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
```c
switch(expression) {
  case constant-expression  :
    statement(s);
    break; /* optional */

  case constant-expression  :
    statement(s);
    break; /* optional */

  /* you can have any number of case statements */
  default : /* Optional */
  statement(s);
}
```
The following rules apply to a switch statement âˆ’

The expression used in a switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.

You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.

The constant-expression for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal.

When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.

When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.

Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.

A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.


nested switch statements
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).

```c
char c1 = 'A';
char c2 = 'B';

switch(c1) {

  case 'A':
    printf("This A is part of outer switch" );

    switch(c2) {
      case 'A':
        printf("This A is part of inner switch" );
        break;
      case 'B': /* case code */
    }

    break;
  case 'B':
    /* case code */
    break;
  default:
    /* case code */
}
```
