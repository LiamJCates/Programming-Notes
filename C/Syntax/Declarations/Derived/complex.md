For complex types, there is a system header complex.h which internally includes various other headers. However I am giving you the summary here. There are following #define macros:

complex: Expands to _Complex

_Complex_I: Expands to a constant expression of type const float _Complex with the value of the imaginary.

imaginary: Expands to _Imaginary.

_Imaginary_I: Expands to a constant expression of type const float _Imaginary with the value of the imaginary value. I: Expands to either _Imaginary_I or _Complex_I. If _Imaginary_I is not defined, I expands to _Complex_I.

Complex types are declared as given below:

        float complex fCompZ;

        double complex dCompZ;

        long double ldCompZ;

Now I will present a summary of library functions provided by complex.h

Hers is a small demo program which explains two functions:

// Complex Number Program
// Description: Demo of complex data type

#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex.h>

int main()
{
  double complex z = 4.0 + 3.0i;

  printf("Absolute value of z is %lf\n", cabs(z));

  double complex zConj = conj(z);
  printf("Imaghinary part of conjugate is now %lf\n", cimag(zConj));

  return 0;
}

and the output is:

Absolute value of z is 5.000000
Imaghinary part of conjugate is now -3.000000

You must note that in Makefile you must compile it like $gcc complex.c -o complex -lm. Note the -lm part. It tells to look for definition of these functions in Math library of C. Without it the program wonâ€™t compile. At this point I encourage you to further explore different functions presented in the summary.

There are even more data types for integral type. I am sorry but I am unwrapping the layers one by one. These types are defined in inttypes.h and stdint.h. The types are int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, uint8_t, uint16_t and uint32_t. The numbers tell you how many bits each data type will occupy. The types without leading u are of signed type and the ones with it are of unsigned type. You can use the good old %d or %i for decimal integers and others for octals and hexes. Have a look at headers and try to decipher them.
