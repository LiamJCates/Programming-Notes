void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete type that cannot be completed. You cannot declare an array of void. It is a generic type in the sense that any other pointer to any type can be converted to pointer type of void and vice-versa. It is a low level type and should be only used to convert data types from one type to another and sparingly. A type occupies one byte. Typically you never declare a variable of void type. It is used mostly for casting.
