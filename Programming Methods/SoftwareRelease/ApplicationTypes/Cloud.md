Advantages of adopting cloud-based applications
Here are a couple of reasons why using cloud-based applications is beneficial for us.
Reduced costs
By having our application on a cloud-based server, we will not need to buy a server
computer, and we will not need to maintain this computer. We can pay for services so
the cloud service provider will take care of ensuring that our server's operating system is
updated and that security patches are installed as they are released.
If our application is storing data, we can let the provider take care of making backups,
making sure we don't lose any data. We can also let these backups be stored at different
locations in the world, so even if one of the data centers our provider is using gets
destroyed or affected for some reason, our data will remain safe.
These are just two examples of how we can reduce our costs as the amount we pay to the
cloud service provider will be drastically lower than if we had done all of this ourselves.
Scalability
Scalability is how we can adapt when the amount of work our application is doing
changes. If we, for example, have a web application running and suddenly it gets very
popular overnight, we might go from a couple of hundred users that are simultaneously
connected to it to several thousand. If the hardware running our application is not capable
of handling this growing popularity, our users will soon get tired of using it as they need
to spend too much time waiting for a response from our application. If we manage the
hardware ourselves, we will need to get more and better server computers, install our
application on them, and make sure everything works. If the interest in our application
then drops, we will now have invested in hardware we no longer need.56 Types of Applications
If we, on the other hand, are using a cloud-based solution, we could, with a few clicks,
pay to get more power to our servers. And if the demand drops, we can downgrade again
and only pay for what we use. This process can also be automated, so the server hardware
adapts to the demand.
Cloud service models
Cloud computing providers offer different services according to three different models.
These models define what parts the provider will handle and what is handled by us, the
creators of the application. These different models can also be viewed as different layers, so
when deciding what we need for our application, we can pick things from all three layers.
Let's look at these layers so that we understand what they can help us with.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
This is the layer that handles hardware resources such as servers, storage, firewalls, and
so on. Investing in services on this layer means that you don't need to buy the hardware,
you don't need to spend time on configuration, and space for data storage will be managed
for you.
Some examples when IaaS is a good option for us are as follows:
• Big data: More and more applications need a huge amount of data. This can, for
example, be data used when training artificial intelligence (AI) applications or
applications that rely on a significant amount of what is known as unstructured data
(that is, images, email, or social media content, for example). These applications
will need to handle large workloads that can change over time. IaaS gives us tools to
add storage and processing power with a click of a button; in fact, this can even be
automated to suit our needs.
• Disaster recovery: The most valuable asset we have in software is data, and we
should always ensure that we can recover from a disaster. If we store copies of our
data in different geographical locations, we can rest assured that we can recover it
even if the worst happens. IaaS makes it easy and affordable to do this.
• Testing and development: When developing applications, we often want to test
them on different hardware configurations running different operating systems.
Setting up different IaaS solutions is a cheap and easy way to do this.Cloud-based applications 57
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
In this layer, you will, among other things, find applications that will act as servers. Some
examples are web servers that will handle web resources so users can access your website,
and database servers that will manage storage and retrieval of data. This layer can also
contain readily configured environments that are targeted to a programming language.
This level builds upon the IaaS level, so usually, you get the benefits of that layer plus the
things that are included in this layer.
Here's some examples of some benefits of using PaaS:
• Faster time to market: Going from an idea to a product that we can start to earn
money from is essential when developing software. Using PaaS will dramatically
reduce the time for acquiring hardware and installing and configuring software. There
are examples of start-up companies that had an idea on Friday and a product that
could be used on the next Monday. This can be made possible with the help of PaaS.
• Reduced costs: Without the need to invest time and money acquiring hardware,
configuring it, installing software, and ensuring all software is updated, our costs will
be greatly reduced. The time we save can instead be used to develop our product.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
This layer will provide you with everything—the hardware, the server software, as well
as applications—and the only thing you need to do is to configure it to work the way
you want it to. A well-known example of SaaS is the array of Google apps. These are the
applications provided by Google, such as Docs, Sheets, and Calendar.
Here's some examples of why you may want to use SaaS:
• Less maintenance of office software: When running a business, we need to
provide email addresses to all our employees; we need to provide them with office
applications such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, and presentation
software. If we let someone else handle the installation, configuration, and updates,
and reduce the time we spend on handling software licenses, we will free up
resources and save money.
• Sharing information: Using services such as cloud storage will make it easier to
share files and documents between co-workers and customers.
This completes our coverage of all the pertinent cloud service models.




Other advantages of cloud-based solutions
These are just some examples of the advantages we get from using cloud-based solutions.
In a 2017 article, The Business Journal lists what they think are the five biggest benefits of
cloud-based solutions. They are as follows:
• Boost cost efficiency
• Provide flexible pay options
• Promote collaboration
• Increase mobility
• Aid in disaster recovery
If you search the web for the benefits of moving to the cloud, you will find similar lists.
Some will also add environmental advantages.
We should also consider that there are risks of using cloud-based solutions. The major
one is the security and personal integrity issues that can be hard to handle when you don't
have full control over where and how the data is stored.
