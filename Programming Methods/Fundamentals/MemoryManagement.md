A key distinction in resource management within a program is between stack management and heap management â€“ whether a resource can be handled like a stack variable (lifetime is restricted to a single stack frame, being acquired on entry to or within a particular scope, and released when execution exits that scope), or whether a resource must be handled like a heap variable, such as a resource acquired within a function and then returned from it, which must then be released outside of the acquiring function. Stack management is a common use case, and is significantly easier to handle than heap management.
