How you compile a program
depends on your operating system and compiler. For details on how your particu-
lar compiler works, check the reference manual or ask a knowledgeable colleague.
Many PC-based compilers are run from an integrated development environ-
ment (IDE) that bundles the compiler with build and analysis tools. These envi-
ronments can be a great asset in developing large programs but require a fair bit
of time to learn how to use effectively. Learning how to use such environments is
well beyond the scope of this book.
Most compilers, including those that come with an IDE, provide a command-
line interface. Unless you already know the IDE, you may find it easier to start
with the command-line interface. Doing so will let you concentrate on learning
C++ first. Moreover, once you understand the language, the IDE is likely to be
easier to learn.
