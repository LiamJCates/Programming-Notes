Primitives
All programming languages have some primitive building blocks
primitifor the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.

language primitives are the simplest elements available in a programming language.

A primitive is the smallest 'unit of processing' available to a programmer of a given machine, or can be an atomic element of an expression in a language.
Primitives are units with a meaning, i.e., a semantic value in the language.
Thus they are different from tokens in a parser, which are the minimal elements of syntax.

In computer science, primitive data type is either of the following
a basic type is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block.
a built-in type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.

In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in.
In addition, many languages also provide a set of composite data types.
Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed starting from basic types.
Opinions vary as to whether a built-in type that is composite should be considered "primitive".

Classic basic primitive types may include:
Character (character, char);
Integer (integer, int, short, long, byte) with a variety of precisions;
Floating-point number (float, double, real, double precision);
Fixed-point number (fixed) with a variety of precisions and a programmer-selected scale.
Boolean, logical values true and false.
Reference (also called a pointer or handle or descriptor), a value referring to another object. The reference can be a memory address, or an index to a collection of values.
More sophisticated types which can be built-in include:
Tuple in Standard ML, Python, Scala, Swift, Elixir
List in Common Lisp, Python, Scheme, Haskell
Complex number in C99, Fortran, Common Lisp, Python, D, Go
Rational number in Common Lisp, Haskell
Associative array in Perl, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Lua, D, Go
First-class function, in all functional languages, Javascript, Lua, D, Go, and in newer standards of C++, Java, C#, Perl

High level language primitives
A high-level programming language (HLL) program is composed of discrete statements and primitive data types that may also be perceived to perform a single operation or represent a single data item, but at a higher semantic level than those provided by the machine. Copying a data item from one location to another may actually involve many machine instructions.
Some HLL statements, particularly those involving loops, can generate thousands or even millions of primitives in a low-level programming language (LLL), which comprise the genuine instruction path length the processor has to execute at the lowest level. This perception has been referred to as the abstraction penalty.[1][2][3]
Interpreted language primitives
An interpreted language statement has similarities to the HLL primitives, but with a further added layer. Before the statement can be executed in a manner very similar to an HLL statement: it must first be processed by an interpreter, a process that may involve many primitives in the target machine language.

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code).
The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options.
Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages. Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing â€” fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing it. Although interpreted byte code is additionally identical to machine code in form and has an assembler representation, the term "interpreted" is practically reserved for "software processed" languages (by virtual machine or emulator) on top of the native (i.e. hardware) processor.
