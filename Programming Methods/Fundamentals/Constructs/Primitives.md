In computer science, a primitive is a fundamental data type that cannot be broken down into a more simple data type. Types define the description of data and the processes or transformations available to be applied to them.

Programs manipulate expressions that have values, these values can be expressed by primitive types.

Therefore, a primitive is the smallest 'unit of processing' available to a programmer of a given machine. Thus, primitives serve as the most basic units with a meaning, i.e., a semantic value in the language. Thus they are different from tokens in a parser, which are the minimal elements of syntax.

A primitive data type is often used to mean either of the following:
  a basic type is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block.
  a built-in type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.

In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in.

In addition, many languages also provide a set of composite data types.
Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed from primitive types. Opinions vary as to whether a built-in type that is composite should be considered "primitive".

Typical primitive types include:
  Character (character, char);
  Integer (integer, int, short, long, byte) with a variety of precisions;
  Floating-point number (float, double, real, double precision);
  Fixed-point number (fixed) with a variety of precisions and a programmer-selected scale.
  Boolean, logical values true and false.
  Reference (also called a pointer or handle or descriptor), a value referring to another object. The reference can be a memory address, or an index to a collection of values.
