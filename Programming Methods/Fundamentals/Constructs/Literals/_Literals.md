In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages support literals.

Common Literal Types:
  Character
  String
  Integer
  Floating Point
  Boolean



In contrast to literals; variables or constants are symbols that can take on one of a class of fixed values, the constant being constrained not to change.

Literals are often used to initialize variables, for example, in the following, 1 is an integer literal and the three letter string in "cat" is a string literal:

int a = 1;
string s = "cat";



Advanced Literals
In addition to the common literal types many programming languages have notations for more complex literals including elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects as well as anonymous functions which are function literals, these are covered within their respective language's folders.
