A floating point literal is a numeric value directly represented in source code that is colloquially defined as a number that can be written with a fractional component.

For example, in the assignment statement:

  f = 1.1

the 1.1 is a floating point literal indicating the numeric value 1.1.

Integer literals frequently use prefixes to indicate a none decimal base.

Common prefixes include:
  0x or 0X for hexadecimal (base 16);
