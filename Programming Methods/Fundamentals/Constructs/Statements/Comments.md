In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

The program that you write should be clear not only to you, but also to the reader of your program. Part of good programming is the inclusion of comments in the program. Typically, comments can be used to identify the authors of the program, give the date when the program is written or modified, give a brief explanation of the program, and explain the meaning of key statements in a program.

The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.

Comments are generally formatted as either:
  line comments (also called inline comments).
  block comments (also called prologue comments or stream comments)

Line comments typically start with a comment delimiter and continue until the end of the line.

Block comments delimit a region of source code which may span multiple lines or a part of a single line. This region is specified with a start delimiter and an end delimiter.

Some programming languages employ both block and line comments with different comment delimiters. For example, C++ has block comments delimited by /* and */ that can span multiple lines and line comments delimited by //.


Programmers may use informal tags in comments to assist in indexing common issues.

Such tags differ widely, but might include:
  BUG – a known bug that should be corrected.
  FIXME – should be corrected.
  HACK – a workaround.
  TODO – something to be done.
  UNDONE – a reversal or "roll back" of previous code.
  XXX – warn other programmers of problematic or misguiding code
