Expressions
An expression in a programming language is a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions calls

the programming language interprets an expression according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a stateful environment) another value.

In most languages, statements contrast with expressions in that statements do not return results and are executed solely for their side effects, while expressions always return a result and often do not have side effects at all.

In purely functional programming, there are no statements; everything is an expression.
This distinction is frequently observed in wording: a statement is executed, while an expression is evaluated. This is found in the exec and eval functions found in some languages: in Python both are found, with exec applied to statements and eval applied to expressions.



In simple settings, the resulting value is usually one of various primitive types, such as numerical, string, and logical; in more elaborate settings, it can be an arbitrary complex data type.

For example, 2+3 is an arithmetic and programming expression which evaluates to 5.
A variable is an expression because it denotes a value in memory, so y+6 is an expression.
An example of a relational expression is 4â‰ 4, which evaluates to false.

In many programming languages a function, and hence an expression containing a function, may have side effects.
In many languages (e.g. C++), expressions may be ended with a semicolon (;) to turn the expression into an expression statement. This asks the implementation to evaluate the expression for its side-effects only and to disregard the result of the expression (e.g. "x+1;") unless it is a part of an expression statement that induces side-effects (e.g. "y=x+1;" or "func1(func2());").

Expression




A conditional expression is just a statement that can result in either true or false, a boolean value.

Compound conditional expressions use logical operators to produce a single boolean value from multiple boolean operands.
