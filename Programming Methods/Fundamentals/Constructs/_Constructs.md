Programming Constructs
In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language.

A syntactically correct symbol sequence is known as a language construct.

Formally, a language construct is a syntactically allowable part of a program that may be formed from one or more lexical tokens in accordance with the rules of a programming language. The term "language construct" is often used as a synonym for control structure.

More generally, Programs are designed using common building blocks. These building blocks, known as programming constructs (or programming concepts), form the basis for all programs.
