A floating point literal is a numeric value directly represented in source code that is colloquially defined as a number that can be written with a fractional component.

Floating point numbers are different from integer numbers in that they contain fractional parts. Even if the number to the right of the decimal point is 0 (or decimal comma, if your locale uses commas instead of periods), it's still a fractional part of the number. Floating point numbers can be positive or negative.

For example, in the assignment statement:

  f = 1.1

the 1.1 is a floating point literal indicating the numeric value 1.1.
