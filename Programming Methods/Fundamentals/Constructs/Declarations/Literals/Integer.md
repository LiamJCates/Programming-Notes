An integer literal is a numeric value directly represented in source code that is colloquially defined as a number that can be written without a fractional component.

For example, in the assignment statement:

  x = 1

the 1 is an integer literal indicating the numeric value 1.

Integer literals frequently use prefixes to indicate a none decimal base.

Common prefixes include:
  0x or 0X for hexadecimal (base 16);
  0, 0o or 0O for octal (base 8);
  0b or 0B for binary (base 2).
