A string literal or anonymous string is a value directly represented in source code that is a string value, traditionally a sequence of characters using some character encoding.

A common convention for expressing a string literal is to enclose a sequence of characters in double quotes:

  s = "string"

where "string" is a string literal with value string. The double quotation marks, "", are known as delimiters and are not part of the literal's value.

See delimiters:
[Programming Methods\Fundamentals\Delimiters.md]

This representation is often contrasted by the use of a single quote delimiter (') for character literals. For example, 'a' indicates the single character a while "a" indicates the string a of length 1.

However, there are numerous alternate notations for specifying string literals, particularly more complicated cases, and notation is programming language dependent.
