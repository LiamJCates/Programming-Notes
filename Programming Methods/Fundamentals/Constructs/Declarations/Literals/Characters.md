A character literal is a value directly represented in source code that is a character, colloquially defined as a symbol, such as in an alphabet of a natural language using some character encoding

A common convention for expressing a character literal is to use a single quote ('):

  c = 'c'

where c is a character literal with value c. The single quotation marks, '', are known as delimiters and are not part of the literal's value.

See delimiters:
[Programming Methods\Fundamentals\Delimiters.md]

This representation is often contrasted by the use of a double quote delimiter (") for string literals. For example, 'a' indicates the single character a while "a" indicates the string a of length 1.

However, there are alternate notations for specifying character literals, and notation is programming language dependent.
