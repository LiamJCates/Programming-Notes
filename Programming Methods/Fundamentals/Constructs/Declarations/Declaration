a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) "means". Declarations are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes


Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the data type (for variables and constants), or the type signature (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays.

A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler; this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in forward declaration.

The term "declaration" is frequently contrasted with the term "definition", but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages

Declarations:
  Variable
  Constant
  Functions
  Classes




Declaration vs Definition
One basic dichotomy is whether or not a declaration contains a definition: for example, whether a declaration of a constant or variable specifies it's value or only its type; and similarly whether a declaration of a function specifies the body (implementation) of the function, or only its type signature.

In informal usage, a "declaration" refers only to a pure declaration (types only, no value or body), while a "definition" refers to a declaration that includes a value or body.

a forward declaration is a declaration of an identifier (denoting an entity such as a type, a variable, a constant, or a function) for which the programmer has not yet given a complete definition.
