Identifiers are used to reference code elements from other parts of our program.

While the rules for specifying an identifier vary by language some standard rules are as follows:
  It can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
  It must contain at least one letter - at the start of the name.
  It must not contain special characters or whitespace.
  It must not be one of the language's reserved or keywords

These conventions, called naming conventions, are common.

The name should be meaningful - it should represent the code element the identifier names.

Multiple Words
There are also conventions for how to create names that are made up of more than one word.

Methods:
  CamelCase
  snake_case

CamelCase
CamelCase is where the words that make up a name are separated by an uppercase letter that starts each word.  There are two sub-types â€” upper camel case (also known as Pascal case) typically used for function names and lower camel case (also known as Dromedary case) typically used for variables.

snake_case
snake_case identifiers use lowercase letters and separate words with an underscore character.
