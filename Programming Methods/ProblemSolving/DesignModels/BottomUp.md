Bottom-up approach
As the name suggests, this method of solving a problem works exactly opposite of how the top-down approach works. In this approach we start working from the most basic level of problem solving and moving up in conjugation of several parts of the solution to achieve required results. The most fundamental units, modules and sub-modules are designed and solved individually, these units are then integrated together to get a more concrete base to problem solving.

This bottom-up approach works in different phases or layers. Each module designed is tested at fundamental level that means unit testing is done before the integration of the individual modules to get solution.


The bottom-up approach, as the name suggests, starts from the bottom of our structure and slowly gets to the top. To be more precise, we start by creating the smallest modules, put them together to form larger modules, and continue the process until we have achieved a functional product. This approach to programming is especially useful when we already have pre-made modules at our disposal.

When we design top-down, each of our individual modules were designed to work for the above module only. When we design bottom-up, each of our individual modules serves a purpose on its own. Therefore, the smaller modules can be used more than one larger module, facilitating code reuse. Moreover, general-purpose modules are easier to read and understand than specific ones, so the bottom-up approach also enhances code readability.

The bottom-up approach is also simpler as we don't need to write stubs for higher-level modules. We write a stub, test it, and move on.

However, unlike the top-down approach, we don't get to see the full picture at first. When we write out low-level modules, we don't have our higher-level ones in mind. This may lead to poor connections between the higher- and lower-level modules. It is also more difficult to monitor and manage the project. Therefore, the bottom-up approach is better suited for smaller problems.


In this approach, bottom level modules developed first (Lower level module developed, tested and debugged). Then the next module developed, tested and debugged. This process is continued until all modules have been completed.

This approach is exactly opposite to the top-down approach. This approach is good for reusability of code.



In a bottom-up approach, the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.

In a bottom-up approach, good intuition is necessary to decide the functionality that is to be provided by the module. If a system is to be built from an existing system, this approach is more suitable as it starts from some existing modules.
