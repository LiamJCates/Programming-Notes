Top-down approach
The basic idea in top-down approach is to break a complex algorithm or a problem into smaller segments called modules, this process is also called modularization. The modules are further decomposed until there is no space left for breaking the modules without hampering the originality. The uniqueness of the problem must be retained and preserved. The decomposition of the modules is restricted after achieving a certain level of modularity. The top-down way of solving a program is step-by-step process of breaking down the problem into chunks for organizing and solving the sole problem. 

Top-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces.

With the top-down approach, we start with our top-level program, then divide and sub-divide it into many different modules. The division process is known as stepwise refinement.

The key to stepwise refinement is that each module should end up doing only one task. Bottom-level modules can be completed using only a few lines of code.

As we design each module, we will discover what kind of submodules we will need, then go on to program those. After programming our smaller submodules, we will group them together into the larger module.

The technique for writing a program using topâ€“down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need.

When we write higher-level modules, we need some sort of placeholder to take the place of the lower-level modules. These placeholders are called stubs. They allow us to test higher-level modules without coding the lower-level ones first.

Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded.

When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.

With top-down approach we see the full picture at first. When we write our high-level modules, we don't need to care about the small details yet. Our lower-level modules are designed with our higher-level modules in mind, and we already know in great detail what we want to achieve with them. This ensures compatibility between high and lower levels. Therefore, the top-down approach is suitable for larger problems.


Advantages of top-down approach:
  modules are developed and tested by order of importance
  project progress is easily seen by developer or customer.
  We can utilize computer resources in a proper manner according to the project.
  Testing and debugging is easier and efficient.
  Project implementation is smoother and shorter.
  Efficient detection and correction of time delays.
