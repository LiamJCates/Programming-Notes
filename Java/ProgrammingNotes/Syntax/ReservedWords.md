abstract 	A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
assert 	For debugging
boolean 	A data type that can only store true and false values
break 	Breaks out of a loop or a switch block
byte 	A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 and 127
case 	Marks a block of code in switch statements
catch 	Catches exceptions generated by try statements
char 	A data type that is used to store a single character
class 	Defines a class
continue 	Continues to the next iteration of a loop
const 	Defines a constant. Not in use - use final instead
default 	Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
do 	Used together with while to create a do-while loop
double 	A data type that can store whole numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+308
else 	Used in conditional statements
enum 	Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type
exports 	Exports a package with a module. New in Java 9
extends 	Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class)
false    A boolean literal value.
final 	A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)
finally 	Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not
float 	A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038
for 	Create a for loop
goto 	Not in use, and has no function
if 	Makes a conditional statement
implements 	Implements an interface
import 	Used to import a package, class or interface
instanceof 	Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface
int 	A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647
interface 	Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods
long 	A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808
module 	Declares a module. New in Java 9
native 	Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language)
new 	Creates new objects

null    A reference literal value.

open
opens

package 	Declares a package
private 	An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class
protected 	An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses

provides

public 	An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class
requires 	Specifies required libraries inside a module. New in Java 9
return 	Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method
short 	A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767
static 	A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class
strictfp 	Restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations
super 	Refers to superclass (parent) objects
switch 	Selects one of many code blocks to be executed
synchronized 	A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
this 	Refers to the current object in a method or constructor
throw 	Creates a custom error
throws 	Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method

to

transient 	A non-accesss modifier, which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state

transitive

true    A boolean literal value.
try 	Creates a try...catch statement

uses


var 	Declares a variable. New in Java 10
void 	Specifies that a method should not have a return value
volatile 	Indicates that an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
while 	Creates a while loop

with

_   Added in Java 9, the underscore has become a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name anymore
